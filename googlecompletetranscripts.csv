0,1,first of all I have to warn you this podcast is for investment professionals only you join me tucked away in our offices and Cannon Street in London as we create Woods deadline for a latest edition on Fidelity on this time its a riskI had to take it wisely what youre about to hear was recorded in October 2017 but its just as relevant today we want to look at what develop markets can learn from Emerging Marketshello political risk is something with investors in Emerging Markets have to take in their stride or at least prepared for the Sucker Punch when it comes but we live in interesting times and political risk is everywhere you look into Bennetts markets as wellfrom an unpredictable u.s. president elections in Germany and Britain and the yet-to-be-determined impact of brexit with Russian interference its enough to make your head real and its been making some developed Market currencyvolatile to make being in the past but Im joining fight to Fidelity portfolio managers Arena Community like who runs UK Equity Funds and all the line from Singapore is Alex Duffy he manages an emerging market fund hello recording this discussionbecause unfolding political scandal in Brazil which sent shares down 10% with an oz and the currency the real another 8% lower arm was telling havent quite thrashed around like that but its still about 12% weaker against the dollar that it was the day before the brexit votesignificant occurrence emus4u becoming increasingly more significant so before brexit we werent used to sing currency moves that more than 4% to yeah well as you know about the year ofnow suddenly we had a very large moving to pick the truck move of 160 to 120 will it was in a very large compared to anything Ive seen before in my investing careers or something that I definitely having to spend more time thinking about now thenIm used to seeing that this is a large positive if you work as well Marcuss is stress testingfind good companies for changes negligence back to his light currencies like more of the prices like interest rate so its so it is it is a critical part of the investment process within Emerging Markets they released the what the dangers are so patheticyou see Im a currency Im impacted as as as we already described with some with Sterling also the first thing that we we think about in the Weevil waste or even prior to the lodge moose this year its is ready to look at the currency exposure of the poorso the UK is one of the most International markets in the world only about one-third of footsie profits come from the UK so weve always thought about our portfolio exposures to the dollar to emerging-market currencies but historically its been moremanage exposures to emerging-market currencies that they have flushed about the bit more rather than worry about Sterling which has been relatively stable historically and what new for me over the last 12 months is really like Alex has been doing any magichaving to think about the impact of Moves In Sterling on the p&l accompanies the Retailers the hedging strategy is something that we have to really focusing on and give a lot more time to then we will used to be able to have to considerexporters in the impact that changes in Sterling with have on that pricing in that four levels of profitability so were having to go down until 12 collect in the emerging markets and maybe take on board some of the techniques theyve been using for yearssome techniques what do you do how do you do with it the currency in 3/4 Weiser at a stock level level as wellin fact that the currency has only on his powerful business so is a rune related to what are the p&l impacts of currency movements how do they change margin structures and some businesses profits actually being slowto buy a particular currency environment actually may be susceptible to change so thats really the first impacted ones it is to understand the underlying cash generation and how that gets impacted by by currents is the second is to have a good lookbalance sheet structure and this is probably more of an issue for emerging markets but often you see situations where companies will borrow in in cheap occurrences typically Euros still in u.s. dollars and then invest thatthat that into Emerging Market assets and when those cash flows from the assets dont match the the currency in which the interest has to be paid back that can lead to severe problems for Equity holders wet when the car seatsbrown suit 3T stress test the balance sheets and make sure the cash flows and I said some dutches is equally matched and then she just finally at a sovereign level its really about understanding what the what the risk to took the carshes all as a consequence and government policies of the consequence of currency price movements so it is the three key areas that I look at the idea of boring in one currencyyour enemies in another is that something that happens in the UK or is that is that something much more for because in the UK deep in liquids a debt markets in in most ofGod sees the companys operating so you have a good match between prophets and borrowing so thats something we dont have to worry about an area what companies have been cold out is more on the hedging so having costs and revenues Im in in different currencies in the best examwas SportsDirect who for some bizarre reason decided not to hedge Sterling even though they buy all of that products in dollars and so 3 days after brexit that came out and said that they havent had done with thePoland from 162 and i-130 that they were going to have a significant decline in profits as a result and this is something that you know wed assumed that they would have been hedging so around the site very quickly ring around pool the other retailerjust make sure they had a sensible hedging strategies in in place but most of most of them dead but I will one or two exceptions and who like sports direct maybe havent felt it through as as much as they could have said they seemed a bit too much and perhapsin the UK might also be in the seeming too much as well until now has a year or two ago it was maybeis the passing comment at the end of the meeting all these costs are going to be passed on to customers are the companies that you like to suck it up from cells one that Sam is going to determineare the proper table from any of the Retailers over the next few months so where we are today is companies who have hatched have been covered so they havent had to pass costs on today at but that edging is running out really as we speak so over the summit will find outcompanies have the ability to pass on that those Rises to customers in which done and Ive been some interesting examples already so the carpet retailers have managed to pass on the cost to customers without any problem Lewis in the hospital Redditsince that night the price of carpet Suarez food retailers African dispensed every time they raise prices it really is under scrutiny so we saw that the press in fast over the price of Marmite a few months ago so I think its going to be a lot more difficult Africacase where the price of that good just honey transparent to pass that on to customers or is it presents a bit more opaque no one really knows what a square foot of carpet cost you can probably get that through without too much problem an Amex what are the differences that remainbetween the the way that you have to look at your investments in emerging markets and I am the person that we all say no in the rest of the world thinks that strikes us in aDemarcus Moore when she passed them what we seen in development has given with a ruler to around that sets of local that Marcus is it really wet cars equals a major problem is one of the balance sheet mismatch and so country such as turkeyBrazil Leo Indonesia we have a very high cost of local debt there is a there is a real issue when car says move aggressively that you have significant write-downs of equity value in that can lead to Capital raisings which apartment losses forfor the princess of the equity holders through that pricing and that comes through to the strength of the Brand answer my experiencethings if you understand the underlying strength of the brand how willing customers are to pay up for for good products from from from from good companies then they tend to be more resilient than then all the players are operating much more competitivecompetitive areas funny arena in young femalesbrexit the me remains unknown unknown so I think that will be more currency volatility going forward that something I have to deal with an unwanted saying again that weve learned from our American colleagues is that if you do have companies withdiverse currency exposures that arent exposed to Sterling at 6:30 to smoke pot that business than maybe we should pay half a bit more for that stability so I think some of the big Global Consumer Staples companies listed in the UKIm such as you need to leave at Diageo British American Tobacco Im into maybe they should credit a bit of a premium to you no knowledge of the fact that they are Global in resilience and about too much for Sterling so changing World to ChangeIrina Alex thank you both very much indeed this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied

1,2,"this podcast is for investment professionals only markets have shown that tea so what better time to give the corporate world a full health checkpast few weeks over a hundred and 60th identities analyst from across the globe have done just that he is serving its a snapshot assessment in 12 months I joined in the studio by three of theseBeckys about consumer Industries at creditxpert industrial and also stops on Equity analyst with an expertise and it welcome to Reams of data provided by you and youreggs from which a pretty optimistic pictures of marriage for the next day or so with that in itself seems a little bit surprising considering the Sword of Damocles of 2017 at this year has have plenty of upsets and uncertainties alreadywhy the optimism with you in particular is optimized is optimism around digitization and what that means in simple terms is turning something physical into something digital numbersso that could be digital marketing the ship from traditional boxing to Facebook Google it could be digital design you know the ship from pen and paper 2 3D mock-ups the shift addition manufacturing and iot and collecting sensor datahe just moving from the old old world of 2D to the new all depend of 3D has a has really sparked a lot of kind of spending and spending intentions going forward in the cool Hangouts in the west coast of Americaindustrialism yeah well its its its quite amazing how far the world has come since maybe two years ago the beginning of 2016 we were very worried about the outlook for China we were thinking that the likes of plank holdand I might be might be about to go bankrupt on no one was really investing in in in these very important markets of Mining and also oil and gas ever since then we have climbed World of Warthe corporates the oil Majors the money majors and Ill flush with cash flow and looking around the edges to deploy more cash flow into capsule equipmentthe basic is a mood of optimism the next fuel companies as well yeah I think this is the first time in many years that weve seen synchronous Global growth and its been a bullet a few years full capsule Goods equipment Marketa number of very depressed and with that favorable outlook for Global GDP growth I think well see more investments in caps equipment over the next few days are you ready to get out of Sunny optimism yourselfthe companies that you you cover for me for me spending and and looking ahead perspective most of them are pretty optimistic right now its not to say that there arent some some issues for example were seeing a lot of volume declinetake the consumer staples companies but Im particularly in developed markets but if you look around the world you see Rising GDP per capita in a lot of the developing World which is translating into increase consumer spending in many of these countries youre seeing people also trading up as they get higher and higher on the wealth indices and generally speaking you see a lot of opportunities for it for many companies to get to grow their therebells and grow their their presence in the world for the new middle classes in these countries are becoming a reality employment continues to remain low on confidence isLehigh you still have this retained spending in this develops part of the world that that weve seen her for a little while now and you get out of this voyage and dump some of the detail is emerging in theis it for the first time in five years the expectations for capital expenditure are increasing over the next 12 months if I think again about the natural resourceswe have gone through some Waltz of a Catholic holiday for the last two three four years on the public as long as well keep some growing as long as population keeps on growing and energy material to mom keeps on growing those capex holidayssingle so I think the outlook for both oil and gas expenditure cap expanded capital expenditure and morning up to Spanish is very favorable as we need to replenish capacity in in oil piercingHills the next copper mine even replacing the trucks that we need to drive around and I and O Mine another strong reading or is that one and five of them that we said they think thatlevels of Leverage are going to increase over the coming in of more non cyclical sectors thats because Leverage is already a relatively full leveland therefore overtime we cant really see them going much higher so at the minute Coca-Cola which is double a rated has gross debt to even saw of over four times its very difficult to see how they can sustain thatlevel and maintain their ratings on aviane Bev which is been just threw a massive acquisition cycle has grossed at see if its off of over five times Molson Coors also big acquisition similar types ofthese are not levels that we would have historically considered even in the investment-grade range and yet these companies are maintaining not just investment-grade but very strong investment-grade ratings despite this level sowell I dont think its that sustainable I think were going to have the rating agencies are going to have a challenge the next time we see a downturn but these are more stable companywill be less cyclical then perhaps some of the other names out there so you know for for some of them they may be able to manage this cycle appropriately its a question of when the cycle turns what I thought was most interesting from the survey is that thesex is what show the the stockist the clock decline in that bridge over the next 12 months is the energy materials sector a surprise given the increasing quality prices weve seen the last two years but also the capital discipline those sexand I think that feeds very nicely into the other funding of this report which is that those companies who will be swimming in free cash flow over the next two years will show an increasing propensity to begin to spend again out of cycle of capitalenergy and materials is just about stuff again I mean hes so flushed with cash that they didnt embarrass mattresses around the world with me what would like to eathappened that how they going to increase its spending for tool on funds as well as theaction of the tax rate both of those together mean that particularly large tech companies such as Apple Google Amazon these types have larger than ever now balances that can actually be deployed within the US and you know part of that will be on Vibersend evidence but you know in the true Spirit of what the lowest meant to do that its not all going to go back in that way and some of it is going to come back and theyre particularly see its way in and see if it can take a Paxof my us Staples companies I would say theyre seeing something very similar in that they are expecting to to get large amounts of offshore cash back on Shore andI suspect that most of that will go towards shareholders I think for the Stables companies its a little bit more difficult to deploy that Capital towards capex because its not clear what they would be spending it on where I think it will goinstead from an investment point of view is more to m&a rather than to capital investment its its its been the story of the last fewbut effectively you have a situation with private Equity company called 3-g really transforming the way that we think about Staples companies and most of them are now so focused on costtheir margin potential that they have been sacrificing growth over the past few years and the only way they can continue to show any level of growth is to do m&a as the companies themselves get bigger theTargets necessarily have to get bigger as well so you see the smaller companies are always talking about more bolt-on m&a on the larger companies will talk about deleveraging from their last m&a before doing something else thats big but yousee the entire gamut of of Acquisitions that are going to be made in this in this market when the need for is amongst Im outside concerts at Freddyswhats what else is going on at the hyperscale vendors such as you know Google Microsoft Amazon for them to run out of capacity you know would mean businesses not being able to conduct their business anymore so thatsavoidable so they need to look at two three four years into space the mind in order to kind of plan for that date Center Rolla. Im so yeah I will tell them were running a capex is definitely bullish time for coming yet but youll sing for the up to the nextyeah definitely should be rolling out data centers in regions where you havent had before and it could easily take a year or two to can never get up to speed before after dead center sensor informationlisten to survey a sink high input costs that up from half lost yet so it could indication of late so I can have some wages also especially in China is the beginning of inflation well I think sets in thefairies from creasing pressure on the cost basis of industrial companies you can see thats if you look at the oil price Stihl price Platinum whatever whatever metal is what goes into capsuleshow goats we are seeing inflation on we will see that eventually passed through to the consumer regarding wage inflation yes unemployment remains remained very low around the developed World Conway beginning see inflationin wages particularly in places like Germany Union negotiations are becoming tougher and pushing for pushing for wage increases most strongly, can I come to you because youre if the stars begin to to take old oil companies going to absorb that because the margins are so depressing that Im totally going to have to pass it on to split a lot of the consumer goods world intopart one is the guys who actually produce food beverage Staples those kinds of things and the second group are the retailers who have to sell those on I think what we are finding increasingly is thatthese tables companies are still getting through their price inflation but perhaps clothing company where demand is structurally lower are not getting through quite so much of their inflation and the retailers are certainly struggling specialIn-N-Out certain developed markets for competition in retail remains very high both from brick-and-mortar competitors and from online competitors those retailers are really struggling to pass on pricingsays to two customers so I think we are seeing the same tensions its just in a slightly different place and the question is whether it passes through two to some of the guys who havent experienced it so fargreasy exactly input prices going up deer and prices spiking and pretty much across-the-board we also seeing is cost inflation wage inflation should I say rising materially to in a lot of it comes to in thestop face cam messed up a conversation but even just basic wages pickle it to backup all of a sudden Germany are all Rising not just for eating the top Rockstar itexperts would have been all the way down to University graduates I definitely seen waitingso you can write well thanks to you all for sharing your insights from the Sexes you cover on a remarkably upbeat report hes about all of the trim and mow so stressful and thank you to you for listening to a full-service As Good As It Gets but looks more analysis IsabelFidelity institutional.

2,3,"this podcast is for investment professionals only Hello in any March chemchina a giant state-owned chemicals company one of the largest industrial Street in Chinaoffered a jumbo-sized bond issuance where they were six billion dollars the largest corporate bond sales on Asian issue essay for this year that was this investment or risk to be avoided at least come join us environmental social and governancewhat shows are enough to put the fear of God into even a hardened investor the company handles millions of tons of toxic discharge every year in a boy is 160000 * 5 to make it handle those chemicals and have to navigate tight regulation in a number of territoriesset time tough enough to put you off well with me today to explain why they went to discourage for that listening is dangerous and to help us understand it better about how ESG consideration really work in the investment coalface here in London my darling director set on the line fromhi Ivan Chang credit analyst ads in Hong Kong Brian Collins fixed-income portfolio manager Ill start with you to incorporate Fayette broadlyis ESG even a possible consideration in China is not something that leads to you at the Forefront of my mind but thats still a relatively New Concept for a lot of issuesI need distance for that matter actually in this part of the world but its its interesting as far as the ensuring that its effective for a lot of investors is increasing rapidly an issue is a responding to it I mean youre right to some extent that forparticular issue a Kim China you dont immediately think about that this is a ESG Champion but its one were by the concept of ESG investing in China is actually starting to become much more relevant a significant investment fromauthorities not just Chinese but Indian and other Regional powers in environmental remediation so that could be relating to renewable energy it could be environmental remediation for water treatment for example andso we sing a lot more investment opportunities come up in that space a lot of companies in this part of the world will have a strong level of government ownership particular in China so the state-owned Enterprises and often they going to not only be providing the service that they Abba.employing a lot of people say there is an element of the service that they have to the country to keep people employed to this very much that aspect and then for my governments perspective about Governor and organizations and we were talking about those we buy Leverage ishighly focused at the moment Sydney excessive leverage and clear your companies have to be doing something if theyre government-owned that are in the National interest so these themes are strong they getting stronger and thats relevantmccamish on his case to some extent the mobility were going to see a lot more of it in the years to come to China for Im a wireless at as an analysthow does ESG play into a company like they described it to United States own. Its huge so its becoming a much more life issues in Ewing China death in company is specialASO ebi playing a leading role in ensuring they are doing good on the SG especially will impact their business as well so if you have noticed that the recent have a talk storm. Chinatown political leadersmore and more focus on environmental issues in China as big as can excessive Mission so they have to make sure that youmental social and governance issue up to standard requirement so I think thats also related to the company and 12 gauge with chemchina around on these topicsnothing is actually Kim China is one of the first batch of coffee babe kind of foot continue to release a sustainable report on the west side so they continue to have the report as early as 2011 and now they have like each year you will have a stinger report detailsrappers on East all on a difference apart of the esmg and also we will also do some research suggests so thats probably the things I do like him tying up and checkyes you say it becoming more of a live sea for you is it some it is becoming a more important factor when you were considering companies its always been a part of the information because the environment issued Association covercan affect the operation results but I do have a feeling that domestic especially from Europe with that getting more and more kind requirement on specific requirement of the company so we are intentionally taking more attention to the SDS back on these companieswhich Im being driven by the investment performance I spent which is what you you told twice Im originally that theres a more explicit requirements that investorsIm trying to be something of a buying spree thats why it needs to get to raise this this cash it support companies like Pirelli the Italian time a carrot sport a syngenta and agrichemicals Company also hereLondon is Mike Diamond director for such you met the company when it was on the London like if its right show trying to drum up interest in the in the issuance what were the discussions like when you talk to them thats correct something by tenaciousgolden they came to us to Europe in the US and I met them all they would London they were issuing Bonds in dollars and Euros so there was a wide investor appeal Hannah stated the the global Road show you my ankle I guess is that I followed syngentaa number of years since you enter itself will be issuing bonds later this year so I wanted to get a better understanding of how can China was going to look off to the syngenta business I was going to integrate this intent business and Ill tell me how it was going to financecancel business when it comes to the market later this year vsg again bring it back to that I had that planned today did they prevent an ESG aspect to the to the company when they when they came to Torchys how many percent is cheap but has elephants already alluduESG is embedded in our research process here Fidelity and has been for a long time weve always focused on governance where is appropriately focused on the environmental angle and the social angle as well and now it just seems to be you know it sounded this this newenvogue rapper ESG but weve always focused on that and its embedded in that process. You know I think syngenta chemchina from ESG perspective in a China has 20% of the worlds population but Im around 8% of the worlds arable land as a hugelunch and feeding his people said as a social angle that is also an environmental angle and sin Genesis Suites of a chemical seeds and science will definitely help them in that process and so it erupts The Whole World War 3how sweet I Thought of You album as well as you gather this information and then Im the processes that you presented back to the team here at Fidelity so23. It wasnt just Brian Collins used in Hong Kong at 1 p.m. property managers here in London as well yeah I mean you know what I say we we we we we do I tried it once before send that back to the team but he isis part of that credit work sample Fatiha manages a more focused on that than others but its definitely a very important part of that process through which of the suit was the question that youll feel them around what is its governance like what are the sort ofsocial angles is it doing damage to the environment those kinds of questions as well as some of the questions that you get from p.m. Brian of course in Hong Kong.If any man just dont sit around the world what are the questions that firing at the taxi company like him China I think the general question as Michael is also kind of describing exactly how the comic does on the SD and then action two things actually I do is actually I would try togather as much as information I can from the company separate gs ngnl do some research on how how things are kind of a manager if I can China I think apart from the company a date of the company office actorthere is some kind of independent research or how come hes doing against his peers like Im Bloomberg theres actually up here come pack comparison how much emission per unit revenue is for chem China how do they compare to a PS and actually but I checkedCamden adjectives that compare increase Global chemical he is so I can I can come back with you Im saying that Ill give him that beverage East so thats an examplebecause it was a p.m. on different aspect of the S&G how much do you have to borrow a company to answer some of the more probing questions from from pnsall these Chinese company ESG was also quite a venue for them so its quite unusual for them to help me talk to you can you can imagine. Call me with only give you good information on yesterdayperfect kind of interesting to find out exactly the company.Michael said that the date you can make us all tires in China and they think Ill tie it to the fuel consumption by car and then actually improving the entire to kind of tried to improve the fishinga few and that can indirectly improve like tattoos with you to fuel consumption help to relieve the environment so I think so thats the reason why the reason that is actually wewe joined some recommended Ill come try that as kind of yes you complied Brian Im coming to you as one of the the PMs that making a judgment call on whether to put money in or not how did you reach your conclusion around Kim Chinabecause of the jumbo do not show it mean that the initial pricing for this particular day was going to be attractive and this is also one which had been worked or cervix and communicated with the investigation we had met them in here in Asia andLondon is mentioned before it was a timeline here way we could actually put together our road is in actually get an excellent education in what otherwise is going to be in an attractively priced investment-grade Chinese state-owned Enterprise soplus the fact that we had multiple points along the curve multiple dollar bonds a eurobond is well meant that it was a wide widely appealing thats really what drove it to me to put into a couple of different portfolios the fact that we had fundamental high quality Chinese Solmaking a large-scale high-profile overseas acquisition with all the benefits that we talked about in terms of bringing that technology home to China and also allowing China to move out the value chain so this is a strategically important series ofpositions became China and set from a fundamental perspective we have a very strong Foundation evaluations would clearly cheap in terms of being added get the kind of spreads that were on offer up for what he saymid-to-high Triple B kind of credit very solid were not talkin about something thats how you here so if you can get it high 100 sort of low 200 kind of spread across multiple points along the curve this is extremely attractive from an investment-grademanagers perspective the biggest sort of drawback in the near-term is really the technical factors because its such a big deal across multiple tranches he needs to be priced and it could mean that at such a big deal trades week on the busand so we do need to be sensitive about sort of these more technical aspects of how the book was built and the book build and all the other indications that the trading team provided back to all of us was extremely strong and gave us a lot of confidence as well as part of that processbest factors of a Kia are important we want to make sure that which direction is this company heading towards is it looking to make incremental improvements in these factors or is it going the other way and clearly we dont want to be having these sorts of factors riskthe investment profile going forward to knowing that theyre being looked at that the analysts and Alvin have done some digging and that we know that there is some general improvements on that front just for the support the investment case is it thatwith doing this research I myself that people like Alvin and Micah are all asking these tough questions its important in a couple of different ways one is that as a firm we certainly use some of external providerssuch as as mentioned by Alvin earlier to look at information available on Bloomberg or to use other external providers like sustainalytics is not complete the Elan pots of the investment universe that we look at itsee when you come into e m and especially when you come into some of the parts of Asia like Tron or like him China with simply you dont have this third-party assessment about ESG off this no third-party score safrole intensive purposesCarowinds bring that into a research as we always have as part of that assessment the great thing about having these external providers is that it provides an external Benchmark it helps you get there faster but we want to make sure that we we bring thatQT because thats our value-added thats how badly wide as bottom of fundamental research is it if we can bring it in when theres no other external source of ESG assessments the other thing thats important here in this is a longer-term it something thattime with done for quite some time that I think were going to have to do more of it and thats really about engagement so if for example when were having these conversations with companies like Kim China or like I was and were asking the more and more about these isE S & G Dynamics we can actually stop the help a true engagement actually affecting some possible improvements incremental perhaps but none the less if were asking these questions if were trying towhat management is doing to improve on these various metrics then that ultimately can also be a positive just through the sheer active engagement as active investors noting enthusiasticallyIm here as Brian Bradley put out in the thing the coverage for the game, especially the companies in China from excellent reports on yesterdays very limited so as a result starting to develop a separate project to focus on a scoring system please call me yesterday coffee like you like em China in China the current demand for ESG score probably is limited we can see a growing demand for that kind of that comment that we were devoting sort of like a type of question listturn sheet for copies actually we are trying to score tile company on the stepper score sheet and thats going to be different from the external cell providers like Bloomberg and testing latex and we hope thats Corbett law firm in research remotely more reliable and the moresmall just Majestic a reflection of the Halcomb that you did on your structured approach to help build that picture yes exactly ready Ryans comments around changing behavior is crucial I think you know we have fidelitywas focused on that from a governance perspective we will always look to you to get companies to behave better from a governess perspective why cant we do that on the environmental side and a social site as well can we I think we can you know I dont think weve met with an investor this year that hasnt wanted to discusssgm what we doing on ESG and how important is she is to have process absolutely great thank you very much in Shanghai thanks to Alvin Chang I credit analyst I didnt want you Brian Collins California

3,4,hello Im Richard Edgar this podcast is for investment professionals onlywhy you should I reconsider my allocation to Asia thats the question Fidelity onzas in this poke house we explore the very latest in the investment Weldon agent challenge some received wisdom and find out whos putting money in the regionIm joined here and Ill honk honk Studio by to investment directors and experts on the reason we footage from now we were just after the announcement of which Chinese Mainland listed stocks do todayis it in the msci flagship Emerging Markets index it is in that Chinese Mainland chest no longer baconI think its fair to say that if we if we consider wearing vest as weve been putting that money in the lost last 10 years or even longer than that Im very easy to ignore the mainland because its building index suddenly they move enciendeand you can no longer ignore it so I did not sense definitely it is a game changer and what it was a means for for acid manufacturers if you like the likes of fidelity is that if you havent already been looking Hsu you can have to stop doing that andits not an easy task and the company is generally reported in Mandarin the company reports will be written in Mandarin as well so you need to get your analysts in place to in order to do that this is not an easy taskhes one of the greatest to investing in in China is that the companys hours coolest reporting in their native tongue so you going to be able to do we take with it then quite simply thisChicagos Pizza on the ground so we will Analyse here in in Hong Kong Singapore Shanghai as well speak the language and anchoring meet the companys Vice device be fed up with the attention that you record heat coatingsWillis msci share index excitement the halo effect of raising the profile of investing in the region and all that we have also a little Revolution going onactually a few weeks ago and now its gone markets to Gary mention this isattracting more attention to Guardian sure marketing channel are the reason is going to leave the lot of The Benchmark for the world which is a large amount of attention tounlock it so were talking about 5% in the survey from berghof case index 4% for China Im sure its not very large size of the China on trouble Marquette12th Street and us. Its its a drop but its a beginning including a she hasnt when we going to meet clients usthe questions always directed towards the equity world and it seems to me that is often ignored ignored but not while knowing that is happening in in a fixed-income space as well and not something which I think is quite important cuz its not justEquity money coming into the main. But the fixed-income money as well which is probably on on the on the whole to pick a water cache how are the clients changing to start changing look on the fixingbesides a fluke at the bond markets D the main player or steal the institutional money if you look at the overall channel on trouble Market overall we have about listen to percent of rain on the ship and you shouldthe composition of this ownership is mostly institutional client like Central Bank silver and wealth found the retail investors should come back later on a lack of confidence its simply a differencestage of development of the market you would typically see First Institutional going when he going there they have more resources to journalize the markets and follow that lead to return investor back to space in the key to unlock thethe market for for investors. Night and that is really something that institutions can can you use a mans its not that easy for the retail retail got to do that companies like ourselves I think you got the questionsIm these concentration clients are asking you both how have they changed over the past couple of years much more receptive I thing to do to a she has them before is very easy to ignore because it was never in The Benchmark who so you couldpretty much say you know we dont know each other companies very well as corporate governance issues and then you could just ignore the entire Market but I forget the market itself if you look at Shanghai and shin Jen that I think of the market cap of about seven and a half trillionset up to Tokyo which is 6.8 trillion pesos in Japan people were because because of the point that we see a similar developmentthe nicotine gum side Ive been in Asia for the past seven years and what I would say is that we are entering the desert face the first phase was going to Europe meeting some International investor and the question was whywhy would I put my money in Asia and specifically in China a few years after that the question was actually can you can you give me a positive argument for me to invest in in in Asia and China because they wont touch to convince us with their investmentwhen to start putting money in China in Asia and now were entering the substation the substage is how how do I do that about to push huge companies some steelMonona Broadway on to the Wells State what impact is that going to have on that business will Festival you should see more so that they say foreign institutional investors on the on the shareholders register which mean I can bring some more questions siteyou tend to get maybe a little bit more activist talk to investors and petechiae great to focus an ESG which is you know as a key theme at the moment Im something thats not even teams have not dealt with that I mean it is a grind theme globeanyway so its over this is it shouldnt come as a surprise to any company but Im at as you get more insulation vest is on me and I said on the show how to register do expect to see corporate governancegeneral question around the universe supposed to hang out with the business in the direction it is heading to do with the money that this investment represents well hopefully the good companies will get the cash that comes in particular you think is us tonightmanager we can choose the businesses that we that we invested sorry for you the best it companies get more cash in the business commented I freaking CEO from International investorwhen I tell them hey look at this Market is growing so fast I often hear well that means that the company are just piling up more thats so its actually from a respond to view this is not a good thing its actually not really the keyits also has to do with the stage of evolution of this company most of the company in Asia and particularly in China has been extremely reliant on the banking system so we using loans to finance that working capital or they expandnow if you see if you continue involving becoming more sophisticated you needs large amount of capital which bank and Ill provide you so you need to go on the Capital Market the other thing is that the most sophisticated to become thewhat diverse you wont use sources of funding today so thats also motivation for this company to come into the Asian US1 Market or International Market so its not the same company issuing more.cremo company and we see that every months you have made an issue a new name coming on the market it requires a lot of research power but at the same time that significantly increasing the diversification potential inspace saver thinking about the best way from the very mega cab companies in the Asia Market do you see them starting to use fixed income markets cuz Ima see a lot of the smaller companiesexperience that hes always saying that happen more more do you think the challenge that this company you have at the moment is is twofold firstly for small company the temperature be higher risk Monday high in space andin China on Shore there is not yet a higher Market whats up the hill company that you would find are actually Fallen Angel thats the first thing the second thing is that at the moment if you see this real name trying tofrom the US dollar market they would have to pay your that would be so high just to make sure make the offer palatable that it would not make sense for them it is going to take time for the small guys to come in this marketturn you mentioned exit management but I wonder whether the inclusion in an index Harolds the decline of accidents showing up because now investors canpop that cash in a funds that the tracks price index get the exposure to get the digestive caitian for example and they can do it very cheap but you have to remember the inclusion at the moment is at will theypipes and inclusion right so effectively that that cat peeing the size of the Chinese stocks 25% of the tree size and is any 334 the moving into the index several thousand about. Four and a half thousand listed companies I mean to bea big chunk is always ready to be on your vegetable for investors like yourself but there is a lot of companies which nothing index for stop site active managers canbeyond the boundaries of the index which it creates Alpha hopefully if you get your so cool right this is another question that Im freaking to get these why would use active management to invest inmarket like China on trop and Im very open about study of the use of passive investment in certain markets highly developed efficient market he can makes a lot of sense especially as a compliment to an active strategy nowcats the specifically channel on trombone Market one of the big challenge there is to properly assess the credit risk of issues do you know that Im sure they have any firm operating system the local rating agencyonly use 3 ratings for Triple AAA in single-a and effectively its only a relatively recent Trend where you see a differentiation in the credit spread of the different the reading group so the challengeI need the national in this store and you try to follow this rating is that you especially if you could possibly you just going to invest randomly and you dont know which are the credit we are going to probably shes going to widen and the one that they were going to tightenso it is really a market for active management makes a lot of sense Las Vegas vacation in terms of the official rating but your point is that there is diversification in the reality of her companys managing the risks of a representits it is normal markets but the the reading dont necessarily reflect this reality if youre investing with active management you can choose the company management you believe are working on your behalf is a shower so dont forget that if you are investing intake me in China where theres a great deal of SOS embracing Sun risks that maybe youd like youre not aware of sexy if if a large chunk of your passive Market is excited and surprised you are investing in companies withyou dont really have a say in whats going on and then on the management is generally is a government proven somewhat and that they can poop be called upon to do national service and sometimes that leads to poor Capital allocation another white Steve the company is being KY Malltold to behave in a way that suits the country rather than show the bank and Luke may be coming up with the best new idea weve ever seen that you happen to be an industry that employs two million peopleand the government may say to me weve got five hundred million dollars you going to give it to Richard because they are they keeping 300 million people employed or is it really if Im thinking from a shareholder perspective and in future right I should be getting that money so late and then hegreat incredible returns in and thats the the industry of the future of sight so without really realizing it sometimes and passive you are you over your putting money to two companies way like I said you dont have the grace is controlling that can be sent me sad occasion campuswhat about the governments in normal companies that do they have a normal structure management priorities Darrell is is that different who is the rightvitamin that is yet to happen in in some of those companies for IG story people will say were governance has is poor I think that you have to think about what we mean by thatquite often Petitti when you meeting companies that do not make a capsular to go to experience the company will be majority by the founder and a couple of his friends that say theyve never have to deal with shareholders before so its notthe Cowboys in there that you know theyre going to run off with your money in the United Fruit and accounting thats not true at all. Its just that I havent had to deal with the expectations of shareholders at and that can be seen thats not bad corporatethis is just an experience corporate governance how do we engage them with with companies like that Investments what are the conversations like theres no other substanceto have any fix in the ground and going to a friends talk to them whether thats 3 analysts the portfolio management team or quite often for Equity Capital markets team who who whose role is to whose role is Corporate engagementto discuss some of the things that we that we hope theyre showing today if youre not from our investment perspective and and and discuss things that we will vote on in and talk about those issues thats a very important and its something that sometimes me surf and turfoutside of Asia is if a cutie if you look at large and small Asian companies they ownership is usually more concentrated to its its usual to have the founder who is the chairman we did this year there is nothing reallywrong about this but to some extent he also explain the explosion of the bond market in the in Asia if you look at back in 2010 when the bank European Bank started to puddingtapasia we saw a lot of this issue coming on the market they charge to change the mentality show more easier to invest or issue a bond and you going to get it rated you need to disclose quite a few informationlike when you disturb at the company and that this has really helped also to improve the governance of the company that sad that we cover this is something that this the same way to goI love this phone I lost it. Message already happened in emerging because its slightly a different topic but one of the things that I usually struggle with withwe say in the store. Download necessary for me that Wednesday the Asian space is Asia get put in the same bucket as emerging market and at least two people to say or to look at Platinum he gets much better yield mr.I think of you and not comparing apples Apple the reality when you invest Im going to focus on the other fixed-income side the realities when you invest in the Asia you invest in about 16 different market and some of them are very good at itif you look at countries like at like Hong Kong like Singapore they have they are very high level of development if you look at the GDP per capita of Singapore is actually higher than the GDP per capita of Germany so is he my point is atits a little bit dangerous to talk about emerging because were talking a good mix between developed and emerging from age of precisely this was the reason that you you change the ringthere is a diversification away from other debt markets but you are lowering the risk of hives that goes alongside that small awareness for what ageslook up to recently when people were looking at Asia they were mostly looking at the year that you can get at this Chase for your TV if you look at a DDD investment that you can make in the bond market in Asia you would get a much highercan you get to Europe but you would get simoleons that you get seen in in the US before the word duration its a very attractive proposition just in time of a risk profile and then people start looking at the difference it overinvesting sure we talkin about the to focus on the Asian US dollar bond market its a its a market that has grown by about 20% on the annual business area of the Boston and yesand this has led also to the emergence of new sectors I feel to go if you wanted to do bats on the consumption of gaming you would have won two names now youre a real sector so what people are seeing is its notme about you is about diversifying there before you into different Industries Grace I know I mean theyre all other factorsthat that we cease been quite interesting within the region for example dividend by then off to Shakopee food to to think of Asia is a dividend Market but if you if you look in marcasite Island by The Deele Carnage by 2.7% Taiwanits about three and a half percent are we weve got markets and is Luke to the set is diversification we we put markets that offer different things with a different types of investors and she saw me yesterday that they were they bred to studyone of the key Drive is Fisher-Price silver tongue and share price Capital Growth is isnt increasing dividends within the Asian region Im just telling you that there are other factors other than growth of course to grow your dividend to you each and we have to grow youyou need to call your business and garlic grow your cash flight Im so that its area is linked but but there are other factors we would be fun quite interesting Anthony Quinn investors put their money into afixed-income what exactly is it that some that I buy a good balance between the black market and emerging-market thats this pointthis what they were so buying is diversification lower correlation with all the market we started talking about the channel on trombone Market again lot of people are looking at this Market because its offer slidea higher yield than than other Market but from my point of view what is the main benefits especially in the market where a lot of people talk about stretch valuation the Oscar for acidityon Troi is providing you with is an asset class which is close to zero correlation with other acetic acid you tell me what is better in your portfolio in time of diversification so I think this is it this is really whats Institutional Investormore and more looking for a good beyond the year Andrew Katz the diversification for control Market is he buying future do I thinkto that it is a new businesses in developing in the region which dont exist anywhere Ive seen it in the world tencent is a great example of this is a a a platform three that we chat platform that has multiple functionWestin the Westin Westin come people looking inside while which we could do that so you are in your investing in the future youre investing in the future growth as well so I just threw out some stats them you know Google4.5 billion people in the region which is about 60% of the global population 35% of the global GDP is growing faster than most places in the world so I cant play sza Indonesia 5% +Great China six six and a half percent India surround 7% gray so that 35% of GPU should grow over time if we continue to see any of the current trajectory which reason to fear changeyoure fake if we do expect me to GDP to continue growing at the rate so weve been seeing if someone yet at the same point in time I use your extra Pine I was only four and a half percent of the global x and x to the new Miss mismatchand fixed-income is Wells at the the proportions of the attic a situation Im a much smaller than that they will be on that turn on that measure about the reasons for that are coming to the end so Im off that an inspiring discussionaxle nut that the good reasons for out for investing they need to watch out for the potential downside of plywood in at the scene in market like an eggJohn is the diabolic tivity this is typically what people would tell you is in a period of uncertainty you going to see much higher authority in the Emerging Market including Asia its actually not beenkids if we look at some I go back to you too in the brexit referendum vote all the Trump election what weve seen actually is that Asian used for Marquette specialty on the investment-grade sideMississippi because you are you are able to move shift money into an environment who is pretty well Shelter From the rest of the world and where you opportunity cost or actually not that its an amazingsky is an end alongside the increased volatility I I must say that there is there is generally great to read her participation in some of the some markets with which does to create motion and so that way you can be on the wrong side of that today theres an elementbut you said one of the things which I mentioned that it is a little State and Enterprises in in the region and our big chunk of the market and if you are passive investor in particular you you all taking on the state and Enterprise riskyou dont always know whats happening with the capital that is for the company has so you said there are elements of race that you have to be aware of Im So that fool and back to the point of why active thats the thats the key on the case of the same place right here in the region isyou trying to avoid those those areas Im Too Sexy the bad thats just want to say that but Im very busy so we going to be here probably over the next few months if notyes about more defaulting in China this is already making the headlines of older the most of the international newspaper from underground is it supposed to keep development its importantmen in the sense that it improve the capital allocation the bad issued Bad Company were appalling that were are just doing MMA inconsiderate way they are going to be sanction the government is going to get his stepwait and say Luke in the store you need to realize the risk that youre taking so it is beneficial for both companies because it helped them a locates capital propertywhat in the store because now when you put your money on the company you know that youre going to be compensated for the risk that youre taking and that brings peppering for that benefitsIm one of the risk to think about as well as that you all taking on institutional risk and and by that I mean that you are still seeing some developments and develop a with any regulatory environment could even be some of the legal fields and incases governments and search Thailand is a great example where we going to see some elections affect elections for number VA is next year a

4,5,"hello and welcome to the July edition of Rich pickings for Tennessees asset allocation podcast in the city of London and if your lookthen youve come to the right place but we have an adulterated sanctuary of thoughts and investment reflection in this month cuz I asset allocation team takes ahead of the 7th to read Market sentiment grit in the systemtrade Wars are all discuss Rich pickings indeed will joining me in the studio all three of the multi-asset team Festivaltwo shot Harrington markets Charlotte this month I want to know what is the one thing you wish you had known at 21 think I wish that I had known how it would have been to know a second languageBeyond English language Chinese will be increasingly so I can post any money to Bill McCracken what would you tell you what51 year old self High I wish Id known that school and wed only appeared in the World Cup once or twice more in my life and that I should enjoy it while it lasts just to explain while recording this very shortlyEnglands disappointing exit from Rutherford to some month would you giveyounger self I think I wish I had known that the value of time only Rises over the years and becomes really precious and you dont know that this is the case when youre youngleads to what to say to it when you have its write thank you all for being here starts with you if the allegations this month has anything changed we had the a long discussionabout what we want to do but we decided to stay neutral inequities and white fixed income and always cash and and it seems that right now theres not much appetite to add orback to take risk of the table so we decided to keep the current allocation sing one of us to Woodside the chief investment officerKing James Bateman traveling this week but I managed to catch up with him about what he thinks is driving sentiment please enter the conference IDinterested at the moment Market is that we know we got him to the sum of the volume. We know that typically a relative truth is softening face facemotor racing in an example of a major slowdown Wilson of the bifurcation between the US and the rest of the world has not taken a stronger in awhile you ask the flight challengeu.s. is being driven by by the Fang technology General consent to us about the market at some point. Of risk aversion.Trump is stepping up his rhetoric on the on the trade War I needed Staffing of his actions and theyre probably going to be further italic reactions I must be maybe 5 launched in the shortsnot really good while markets in the particular a specific facts as I areas if it looks like theyre going to be talkative so the base case rastas there is a limited pieces for being overweight but a very strongbuying on any see you any actual weakness that comes through over the summer. Im at again as I said lost dont think thats a reasonable chance that we will move back to my position equities come Septembertype time shooting Marcus Ive had a game the best over the summer law that was James Bateman speaking to me a little bit so Im essentially this is a repeatsomething you said what you said in May and go away well looking at the macro date at least we see that the fundamentals and not deterioratevery fast but not accelerating either and this has been the case as indicated by a leading indicator now for a few months so its its not its not worried ifI think the data is probably finding some flaw right now on a global basis but its hard to have a very strong connection either way you look particularly concerned them if the fundamentalsCity Cycles where they are at the moment the fundamentals of settled weather on the moment I think we had one month of sideways after several months of Decline and and if so smooththats I think we do in most of all models and then so on actually the direction of travel at the moment is still lower it to the idea that the US stands out as having held out much better than everywhere elsethat becomes a quick question for us going forward is can the US maintain that strength given the rest of world weakness and I think even that were starting to see some very very early and too hot to really make a big cooler on it but somebodysigns that businesses in the US are to take to be concerned about trade and there are some some constraints within within the market last nightare you waiting and seeing through the summit at 4 I have a position once everyone comes back off the SEMO todays well at my aunts at the moment is on the defensive side in theIm a bit more cautious on equities and some of my colleagues and a bit more advice to us if the bond market talks about the lead indicators in the snowGoogle Chrome. Shanley be important for me other developments high or low prices higher interest rates stronger dollar these are conventionally challenging episodes for markets andencourage one to the air on the side of caution as far as you see that changing because you see us getting through the next couple of months I think there is a risk to the US state that deterioratescountdown welcome for Marcus those old so that said building narrative around trade is not particularly helpful the Silver Lining is that we we could see some of theBaton Rouge I mentioned a moment ago that are currently at settings of head winds for Global growth a weaker dollar Shoot actually said this4 ride for I said prices to to swing up from the end of the summer Ronald fine if you go down a bit deeper and you looked at some of the sexesyou seemed defensive sectors do much better if you looked at regions you seen the hi Ibiza regions before much West Side Market September take any punished in currency wild you seen some of the most often and some defensive currencies.aseptically the dollar and Im so actually that sort of shift in mindset has played out its just played out in different parts in the round table contains thatI think contentious View today is that we had a bit of a slow down but things are stabilising risk appetite remains reasonably healthy in the ravinder there are sometimes referred to as cracks in the iceproblems in emerging markets in one or two sentences into one but these are viewed as being the exception rather than the rule to go back to your question what would get me more excited about flying riskMarket becomes more and more frightened of whats going on for sentiment to deteriorateone of us has to take that possibility much more seriously and in those circumstances yes comfort from from from the Daishaits quite helpful to stay away from the market for a few months and then to come back and assess whats happening with a fresh pair of eyes and when I came back and I looked at the and thissentiment that Bill had just mentioned a bus is the date that its a bit surprising to me how bad is the sentiment is because even though we have seen some growth deceleration Global 800x us grossis still well above Trend in most countries including the euro-area perhaps China as well despite the Slowdown so yes it grows slower but were not near merecession and noting in the US and Im not in any other significant country st. Marys parishI think expectations of stool for risk assets to deliver positive returns in 2018 and for the system to to hold together I thought Prince route bearishnessbelieve me this is far from a bearish environment when poop when people are bearish you can you can feel a very heightened level of tension and fear in Marketits a snow village Village absolutely no Id say that we much different years ago with the differences that things werepicking up a year ago today I will pass the peak things are slowing down and was the level of various indices indicators might the same as it was a year ago I have to beif we supposed to be like in Napoleon went to the Moscow he went through various places on the way they only went through the same places in the way by the mood on the way back is very different from the windowI think Ill say he look up positioning positioning on that she people are still generally are still underway bones so even if they might be more cautious than what I saying its not being reflected in those fund lightswho coaches in what theyre buying an overweight Equity so theyd be more selective see think only imagine. Get something and provide selling them for Crest Sunday. So. Daytonacase if if thats kind of am I guess its a good indication of peoples risk appetite and furthermore I think you will have to take that cyclical say down and come available a violation search like which is very high on a 60-day Chester basis and sayand that environment when dilation too high on Grace rolling either it does make you a little bit more worried move on to something youve already spoken about the trade War I which is ramping up as we speakbetween the US and China how worried should we be about this because Im initially people were very sanguine that United the first round of tariffs that were being announced TDI didnt really make any difference I was just a little bit on the on the charts but itserious and I think thats right there at the initial announcement is Trump doing what he does in and sending Tweets out nobody doing not too bad it didnt think 74%impact I think thats a negative sentiment impact soup to working on from an asset Market spective Andre I guess they have to be quiet so how does that actually affect the nature and I think it does affect the way thatbusinesses behave and how they think about investing in if we look up tryna tryna is already 6 increase living so its hard to think it makes that the Chinese economy that 500 limit on the trade was he described as beinggrease in the system what what did you mean what I mean is that weve weve enjoyed a very smooth free-flowing trade Marmot on a macroeconomicmarkets of being dominant and efficiencies have been so out by by companies and has benefited the notion of applying.and slowing global trade an encouraging companies to the lowest-cost environmentPrince Art and Science of equipment putting grit in the global economic machine youre encouraging and efficiencies in the system and an unrest thats what I meant when I met.and it would you expect this when would you expect this is how it showing up in the invitation size of the tire of the Moundstoso the retaliation by China all the countries and what products are affected and what whats the substitution elasticity there are so manyvariables that you would need to know to precise list to my Dame parked us estimates suggest that actually democracy impact it is relatively banayan a quadrilateral banana tons of clothes and inflationbut I also think if we assume that this is going to be a protracted the fat either its not the midterm election I think its actually going to continue over the nextyes in some sense like brexit were not going to get a big negative shock in the next quarter because of this its going to last for a long time and perhaps slowlyput downward pressure on you to be a nap with depression inflation but its not a 1/4 phenomenon its reasonable to expect in the showmotus probably very modest adjustments to to growth expectations time was the effect might be a bit greater introducesIm sandwich into the system it depresses me Jimtown growth expectations magenta meditations by investment and that is really interesting that nobody can reallyanticipate what President Trump is going to do next so how do companies react how do you how do you anticipate how this is going to play out over not just 1/4 you say Im at that time but Ive a multipleyes I think thats thinking through this as we speak so theres some tools that Pap smear fuel company producing something in China maybe you guys can move your productive citizen to Taiwan to Vietnamtell them its the US that but then maybe the second reconsideration is a well what happens if Trump decides that he doesnt want us to do that and then comes off dressing on so probably tastes like ready to face the laundry side to sideyou got a. Of doing nothing stagnation all messed up on these decisions and and that I have a time is quite negative effect is totake Trump out of the picture for a moment and think about us policy for a number of people are suggesting that havent won the 2016 electionthe US would be taking a more aggressive stance on the on the trade front and particularly with regards China so if you accept US policy for several years looking for what is likely to befocused on changing the US trading relationship with China then one can make some judgments about how thats likely to play into Financial Market come back into the picture how he zig zagsdirection of travel gas and nothing anyone can say with great confidence that they know what the next move is going to be but if you know the direction of travel then you can submit me some.that might be right for China though but if youll Europe. This is all coming at Five Below not just trying tothis is why I asked about the global economy because so many economies are no into linked with the global economy with the the trade with his Im traveling through many different markets parts for differDefine geopolitics, so have you could all start to unravel. Thats thats the machine describing the efficiencies weave were taking advantage over the last 35-40 years if you start to tear apart do Supply chains then the machine wont work as well as giving the 600 backdrop that weve talked aboutdeteriorating things always look a bit worse through that lens and if it wasnt for the fact that hes already slowing I think it might take more optimistic view and say what this is but its the backdrop that colorI think if we go back 12 or 18 months when the cycle was swinging up once investors are inclined to ignorelonger-term negatives because the focus on the fact that things are getting better and I like that you can things get better once you pass the Peak View becomes I see things are getting worse and maybe going to go watch the gamecan you look at those longer-term influences and slightly different we Rollin fishing tube on side you think I dont look so good either. PleaseI think we all need cheering up with the light cyan dimes that time its time to pay hotcakes and potatoes what would you like a hot cake with you drop like a hot potatoaccessible I need to say Mexican currency and I think weve got through the worst of the incessant see what the elections and structurally healthy economy Sundayrest of that time very synced into the US which is still doing all rightEurope is to some extent leading the downswing diem basis is one of the West, knock it its been cold in them I had wings of trades in the Note 8 versus Germany or so big pause part of European equities in the I mean that stuff that program they going to go for MDMAstructurally and I dont particularly like this asset class for a number of reasons I think tactically given the correction I told her I just seen it might be a good coupleright now it is again on the very basis at yes with in emerging markets at an outside but as a concept as an asset class I think is attractive for this point in timewhat would you drop like a hot potato has to be $2 and its its extremely hard to have a very high conviction on the dollar right now and I hear also the fed the old different views and defend argumentat 4 a.m. to do well the daughter has to be either at least be stable or to weaken somewhat and actually I think perhaps the narrowing of the interest rate the FrenchDallas particular between the fat and they should be and some other Banks might give rise to this Transit list over the next few months to the end of the year so I think we could dollar Im so sad celladoraokay Im Bill at your cake hey my hoe cakes actually related to what islands just describe the US economy as we can and I think US TreasurySayed the 10-year bond with that deliver positive results against a backdrop to a buyer of 10-year treasury of Sammys are famousviolently cyclical and the last two years has been wonderful for companies in the semiconductor sector but there are signs of bad fundamentals training drive if I cant inI intervene as the last 3 weeks then I think we could see a meaningful Saint Laurent win semiconductor send that.

received by the central bank and at the same time a political situation that is making investors very very uncomfortable with the US women with the u.s. into so where is it going how how do youwill feel about turkey its a its a its a situation that is changing a lot day by day have you changed your view on the country James material draft position in Kentucky anyway so well have Emoji mugs exposure by 2018perspective but its its Broad and diversified and I think a starting point is when situations of this fluid moving this fast thats not the time to make rapid changes in a pool party so I think you know what I think about you I think about the implications Im not really focused on the 1stdrifting impact which is Kentucky stop so took his phone so Im thinking if it really goes wrong if the situation really does get out of control what are the second and third derivative impact so European Financial Straits on pool contagion risk into other emerging markets and then I guess.with thinking more broadly on the balance that maybe want to reduce some risk that in in in in Prospect sign potentially happening with the fact that maybe it wasnt and actually maybe this is a storm in a teacup Id end 6 weeks to 8 weeks down the linelook at what I moved on back to a post of narrative is is this is the risk of contagion or is it contained how could the transmission mechanism result in Contagion risk and James mansion it could be atthrough the banks of the banks like youre still blending into all the parts of the market especially to emerging-market friends that have a lot of external at that that a lot of dollar for instance I can see that is turkey an isolated case the way that its goingdoes that matter is idiosyncratic credibility lakoff or the political situation most countries dont have both might have one that might have the other but dont have bothwas not respected at the Nordstrom product but we still do worry about that big potential contagion risk what do you think instead to the crisisthe potential to spill over to you and other markets particular to those countries that are also quite vulnerable such as South Africa Brazil and other emerging markets and its not the story of OJdo you know of any so I have that that we have seen over the past few years its because its so very vulnerable and this is all happening in the environment where a global liquidity is catching withdrawn so fab by the Fedalso next year by the ASA be on some other big central banks so I think we shouldnt be complacent about it particularly in the light stage of the cycle where are the risksintensifying Sprite way would be next to you think I am so thats over all the time they have abscess Central Europe as wellthey do have days to be potentially helping but OSHA has foreign investorssaid it to corporate thats to a sovereign that is plastic they still dont have a stable political situation is Contagion what are you looking forvery fluid situation until I gave it to him what could make this bread so you never quite know why you got contagion because I see it and its essential that the average nowaverage Market participants Naruto shifting from we go to the isolated problem to one that could be more systemic so most of stomach is simply yours arent Banks we supposed to write down Im all right of Kentucky statshappy to have a massive impact on Europe it would also have a big impact on other emerging countries where I think the market would start saying what if this is next I think Brazil is a clear example where that could happen to the market says okay Williamstown Kentucky for a badJessica me next is going to be Brazil the big risk in that is not just that it happens to those countries by the apps you got a massive negative sentiment crossword emerging markets in discriminately we saw your Indian currency sell-off Im quiteon the Turkish music you look at that Ethan will actually India is not in the same situation but the market sentiment is depressing every what. Thats what makes it better or systemic bad she more bigger impact in terms of the offal MarketIm tired of this this contagion and that the James is talking about is not going to just spread to yam and stay there this is this has the potential to be such a big Financial shocked that it would spread todamn markets including the US and with Titan Financial conditions so dramatically that it could affect economic growth elsewhere but particular. Marcus particular the USwhats the address to get moment is the US has been almost immune to it a little bit of all this was your lost diver face its been immune to it and and that doesnt give the USA and incentive to help with Sofia shoes kid if you stop seeing impact in the USeconomic clear in the markets that changes the u.s. is incentives and turn of times are trying to resolve the Chucky crisis in this case I think that the two are actually intertwinedlet me see the bigger picture I know you said in your briefing yesterday that the u.s. set conditions for the rest of the wealth of China sets the grace agenda for the rest of the world it is mixed girls has definitely beenand thats without the big stimulus that we saw in 2016 that has been that slowly I was drawn so the investment in infrastructure has fallen quite dramaticallywe see thats in some of that to attend to get this house is slowing on the other hand has been some small steps to try to limit the downside to grow with but theres a staffthats a Dosa Palace has directed towards physical winterizing a probably not going to be enough to put the floor to the slow down somewhat change direction and with change of Directionalso comes opportunity so one of the areas that we actually been discussing in the team is Asian credit trying to high-yield China credit and thats been one of part of the what part of the market that has actually show the significance of a little more than European high heelsItaly situation and weve been slowly looking at that as an opportunity Market but looking then for a catalyst and this somewhat change of direction from China with thinks put a bit of a stop in this bed whining environmentviews are actually very attractive as usual weve taken refuge in one of the stuff kitchens here at Fidelis Efirddigression with a portfolio manager whats not to like I think this isdo you like actually Im what does complacency to run the United States but if one looks under the surface and look to the Future as far as the consumer are these fine butlook at the housing market if you look up Altos surprising the week for a healthy economy and I consider things out of oil price in the fact that will interest rates have risenBombay spice the u.s. is not immune from that and its still enjoying the benefit of the wheat dollar last year but this year the door has been stronger and I think all of those things in the second half of this that she might begin to wait on the on the US economyoptimism that you described is that we stand at the momentthats really because my my view this year has been that we we want to hunker down and be somewhat defensive with a portfolio allocation and the u.s. is classically defensive Market to to to thisIm actually like to us Equity Market but for the reasons Ive just articulated I think we need to reappraise that view and make a judgment or for the those defensive characteristics will be helpfulsecond half of you as a happy in the first bill went on to say that he lost himself every day whether the US will continue to serve as a safe-haven are you as concerned about Mariah Carey says he has a motive to Mystic than Balethe US economy a particular talking about the second half of this year and of course I agreed that the u.s. is in the light cycle and the things that and the bill is concerned aboutJoshua Ledet the characteristics of the light cycle consumer house in state of the housing market in the water sector Etc but there are two key things thatwhat the US economy today end of the year in potentially through 2019 and that is the physical support did the physical boost to transport the tri-tip and alsothe monster policies of again if you look at the financial conditions that still remained very accommodatable have seen some tightening over the last few months but its still not enough to put a significant Dragon you escrow so thats why Im going to stay asleepdown from the 4% growth that we saw in Q2 but I dont think its going down to trento Baloch and its not going to be very rapid so Im optimistic for the end of the year to all things being equal JamesIm certainly nothing to knock knock it said it should plow on I mean eat at it leap an event since its hot but reject tree has been almost unbroken Im so beautiful sitting in the text talks not that long ago.not much to propose to Hannah and I do agree with Anna and youre allergic to that time Im not long. I was in the US and the positive sentiment that a sense of competence the average consumer is unwavering and addultimately competence is a large part of what drives the economy and markets and that is positive and therefore I think the US it is Curtis Lee to 50 defensive thats good if if Marcus roll over but I think it could well continue to leave Pockets offmixing up the defensiveness of the US market in my thinking is that when the problems are exerting out of the US thats when the US market becomes a defense Morgan if holler the problem stop putting in with himu.s. Market Im not sure its going to be exactly as defensive as investor expected to be especially at a time when funds investors out of the highest allocation overweight to the USA flea market in a very long timeprimed for something to go wrong in a sense that in addition with very narrow leadership that we have seen very few number of stocks that are pushing the market High Jinx you made a point in that the meeting abouttake some time Horizons of being underweight doesnt necessarily mean sending off today how does that play So I think youre clearly when youre when youre investing you should be taken from the device is not in the month Leo4C bases and on that basis you might think were trending towards underway or trending towards a knife weight that you put the time those positions I think when we look up your emoji markets not one of the debates we had his is this a buying opportunity should be selling at this point.the turkey situation and I think the answer was hold fast but with a view that you need to be quite tactical on a daily basis spending what happens and youre one of the things you have to think about whatever managing a portfolio is what happened today has the monkey overreacted versereality or should I that will change my positioning and and particularly when sentiment short and Central drives markets the ability to take very short-term decisions when you see it at what if a table is an irrational dislocation can I have the most valueokay I didnt lets assume then that things Bumble only say yet as they have been for the next couple of weeks or safe when should we start to be wary of a big shift in sentiment if we look overthe last few years its been very late August early September when volatility is picked up with that weve seen a bit more Market concerned Im not sure whether that is a kind of cliche back to school or whether thats simply as people beginning to look forward to the to thenext year and looking whats going to happen in this town this case in 2019 Roth and just focusing on 2018 Market participants must be back in the office looking at thingsclear head at reassessing but interestingly every single time we seen related to that market so then resume their own food Trend and so I think it would be very very worried if you took the view that because that was happening what was that myand youll see some serious golf Georgia to get away on holiday are you going to be happy to switch on your out-of-office reply until you come back I guess it went when one goes and I guess I always happy to do that but tell you no one hasit has to be on top of things even even went away because it is all goes through his lack of liquidity and things are moving what I would be looking at is to what extent we see this spread widening environment continue in if we see also currentlyEmerging Markets continue to devalue that would probably lead to negative more negative sentiment could potentially to outflows for emerging markets that would make me worry a little bit more like a note before we pay a text note potatoes what would you buyinfusiasm like a cake and what would you drop like a hot potato Selma hotcake is the Japanese yen versus the dollar and I think it has sent both the fundamental reasonsto be stronger ratatori just now but those of course the sentiment trees and its its one of the safe haven send out there in case of fire or any toxic crisis and my hot potato would be watching American equitiesemerging-market I could just within the last time Cubs versus Asia going back to the team that we discussed on vulnerabilities within the a.m. and and also they have already done quite well so I thinkthats what they say something to sell MLP essentially it is a relatively cheap way to play the energyMarket specialist late cycle and energy prices have been a gradual grinding upwards and its also a way to play the market with a very attractive in high-heeled helicopter what is a muscle Emmett Townshippipelines Mitchum pipelines in the US it sent you the pipelines thats on the transports oil companies not the oil itself but the means of getting around precisely which means they haverelation with oil prices but at the same time some immunity from big people activity and change my cake is US tips to uscountries they provide long-duration good head GIF if markets will from here and a patient protection and Im still worried about inflation getting out of control potty trained by the the constant grinding up the oil price team if you was infrom then on the on the on the Hot Potato side its European equities already European financials which wire me because there is this contagion is Kentucky and I think whether or not turkey completely gets out of control you could see a

6,7,"hello and welcome to the September edition of Rich pickings but that is his asset allocation podcast editor-in-chief of some very old and very complacentappellate restoration buy coffee from the shop at the bank Im going to put my cappuccino to one side because in this month because we delve deeper into Data that suggests the slowdown in the global economy maybe tonight Highway Emerging Marketsknock that Sunny pick Jim and why Australia is better than New Zealand oh yes indeed listen to find out whyjoining me in the studio Boss 3 of the multi-asset team back from this summer break and already deep into that asset allocation ranging they off Charlotte to Harrington buckets out of shut it this month I want tonight before we get getting what you wantno fair you say Heights which is not taste the irrational it does become irrational when youre in a hotel room for the cousins open the cousins for looking out the window at us like the old good tonight.what nonsense gives you Goosebumps really like being rational and irrational fear but I have this very irrational thing of after I go snowboarding I dream about it and I wake myself up becauseThai food delivery in the dream I actually jump out that thats the point with my wife now I aint sleep in the same bed as my office if you guys are all so my focus is always itchystatement Chief investment officer the most as a team James whats your most irrational fear why I guess I would never admit it was a rational but Im not a big fan of spiders but since Im not completely unless I science acne preclude Sutton Im JayGary has fought for holidays this month in any change to the allocation sorry to disappoint you Richard but the answer is nomight as well be positioning which is neutral equities overweight cash underweight fixed-income we did have a bit of a debate whether we should actually neutralize our cash on fixed-income positions as well but you cannot change your positioning without passing throughadd an at the margin we will probably over the next few months be reducing cash an increase in fixed income so that would just be a Polish to remove that we know were going to like you to make. You set us up for it so Im very well. Did you agree with them where we ended uptruly Im probably a bit more rest of us in that so I probably prefer to hold bit more Direction and and Baby Expo Steven on the equity Market Northeast Market its already been the US versus the rest.set of convergent sticks like its impossible. So how are you doing for the rest of the group on the side of things like holding some duration hairshe did logic die applies if you put ever session at any point in the next 10 years 3% looks pretty good on a US 10-year phone wouldnt hold it in. Discussion with walking sound list in SamsungI lost him about Fidelity is leading indicator the fly is being stuck in the negative and worsening quotient for six months in a row exactly what you wanted to be but he explained this cycle isnt yet maybe nearwelcome to the Fidelity conferencing system season 2 the conference ID case of signal is itif I doubt theres some sense of stabilisation now I always cautioned not to read too much into this but given the indicator is designed to leave by by three months but negative deceleration seems to be boxingperhaps around the turn of 2019 we might be talkin about actually things stabilising could drive that economically what weve always said that there hasnt been a significant enoughSonic shock giving her strong growth was last year to move us from a mid-cycle light cycling tactful recessionary territory theres no real candidate for it for a while that should happen to stabilisation I think was always something we expect hisand its something that looks like were getting a bit closer to teetering on the brink if you like for a month but it suggests that place economically speaking what could knock that.well it has to be Emerging Markets right at the crosshairs of slowing Chinese growth at fat tightening and a stronger dollar and more idiosyncratic blow up there so Im seeing and theyre really vulnerable Emerging Markets Alexa CherokeeTina how do you say Jason Crescent Humane that at the conditions there are unique to those individual Economist Im not the sort of thing that might spread like wildfire through other countries share the other emerging markets in terms of credit card thats itexternal glass in this so much worse that we dont think you can extrapolate from there to India Indonesia even a Mexico soap all these countries removal Sounder pressure still it doesnt feelI cried we can access stanshall risk stage quiet I think imaginespecific date has been overseeing thats been where the actions been over yes I was seeing the currency that came out on the fixed-income market will set off quite aggressively and Ozzy and says its been down to a stronger dollar the butt tightening and a Chinese growthtrade tensions with the US so whats the move has been quite aggressive the conditions that had formed the backdrop for that movie actually in place of tickly on the Chinathe things were yes they are starting to to stimulate the economy but were a long way from really seeing that the dates of change of the back of that explains how the conditions in turkey and Argentinaunique at least to some degree if you could do that but what about the other countries youre right choice the questionwhenever whenever you see an issue in a country is it systemic is it or is it just in contact with some of the products exported applied to other places where is it contained to that country. Region and I think when we look at Turkey we dont see it start to systemic issues we dont think its I meanhes like the impact old imagine markets not do that for we think an extent that the negative sense run around Emerging Markets have been overdone it may be that the other Everest Karambit rise of the country is Brazil Brazil today as a democracy political situationand I didnt think will be the next turkey but I think with this those that we might identify placesKentucky is being back to stomach actually the set of an atom has been very broad-based so it was seeing it in Indonesia and India places that are supposedly in a situation so itsits hard to ready to draw a line or is it systemic but the waydescribe four fours as that it is in crusty going to affect everything else but actually the pockets of issues you see any M have an underlying systemic Elementary US dollarsthe the tightening of monetary policy in u.s. and the the fact that that puts it kind of is it makes the tide go out if that its sort of LeapFrog Trucking from one event to the otheractually everything is might might not have a dipstick the story of the day but everythings moving in that direction and it takes this label black truffles off Grayson and a stronger dollar the US seems to be staring a lot of that you votedset max but Im can you explain a little bit more shot at why America message so much at the moment the the u.s. set monetary conditions to toe.I love the Wild and say this gradual pace of normalization is says the federal budget is is starting to tighten policy not just in the hospital so thats why they say that everyone else has sointerpretation that everyone else seems to be hoping the FED is going to be pushing on that day so it might be about 2.75 to 3%and then take pools I didnt see a huge amount to ready change that view at the moment I think its entirely possible that you asked Greg to Slows a bit from Heaven that. Rate hike path still ends up in the same placewhos in times of the pace maybe you skip a quarter or whatever but thats would be that this over the interpretation on their phone see the FED is essentially setting monetary policysafe up 70% of the worlds Commodities Financial systems a lot of depend on it for the feds Monday isnt that the feds Monday is domestic and say what what youre seeing to send degree is thisdisconnect between financial markets and that to Amanda is fed and youd need either for that domestic picture to change oil for that other picture in the rest of the world to affect the domestic picture ofthe fat to really take notes wedding change that course because of it but if no man is an island spend the FED might realize that its own economy is going to be affected if the policy but it sets affect the rest of the worldis a subject that gets wrestled with the law and their different opinions on it and I think thats where it comes down to some personalities within the fat and how they interpret that but I think they would really have to interpret it as its going to affect the domestic economyand therefore we quit were going to do this but this is this is the thing with a policy its its its the FED has been so dominant to financial marketsI think were going to have to see what see what comes it have excites a higher interest rate to say housing vehicle salesall right since 2000 and thats living on the other point around the FMC being being quite balance issues for them is that youve had a boost from tax cuts which which we know is is is temporarywhite people fade in and that makes that job all the more difficult because they didnt want to edit the Titan into a picture that ultimately is going to slow on its own accord and so I think that thats an extra twist to this I caught a short-termtwist as well because we expect that stimulus to you run out by the end of next year so to explains why why theyOceanside the way that policy is being decided that a course affect the US economy of the biggest driver in the economy is its consumers how it looks to be booming at the momentmerchandising whats interesting is is the that both are notoriously and and in the data can you become very strong and and what are on the scene recently is the ability of a corpus to push through price increasesregarding pricing power consumed is all Im continuing to spend sit sit which is always a very strong sign for the economy and indeed I think some of our Intel estimates is suggesting that maybe were pushing out the downtown another yeah in the US economy spot pretty majorI think theyre related pointer that theyre coming back to the fed and monetary policy is is clearly that if firms will they have pricing power Im a sign of further information to come but the other thing that perhaps might underminethat Rosy a picture is everybodys convinced by the future of US economy it seems Im if you start looking at capital expenditure capex that companies say they going to invest but seems to be sitting on that cash insteadso theyre there are Im crushing High Country Club so thats been a phenomenal in the in the US market for a long time the interesting point that that when we have time this morning to us was that its getting harder to seeing a shrink a Pax and Pax Intex panic and that for Atchleynumbers might be giving but you the wrong impression of what companies are actually doing so they all spending you think you might question whether an element of caution with some companies but at the same time Im hotThe Narrative that said us companies are acting cautiously Im worried about him in the damn time then when you wanted to talk about inflation you famously why are we now entering a time when you feelcome true I think Mike my consent is increasing. She is as we discussed last week and it in a separate conversation when I was at University one of the books required reading it this. Was the death of a Nation by it by neutral and ever since then its trap musicyeast infection is over for us a concept and we just seen an unusually long. Where is the mood to Central Bank Independence in the 1990s and benign or negative economic conditions have combined to mean that the inflation hasnt hasnt really read its headits like you two again its most likely to when people arent expecting it and I still have them into naivety in the mouth yet about about inflation and either you can wait Rebecca getting price inflation and you got the impact of oily put all those together and you say this feels like a precursor for above Target in faceinflation surprises like a country in any way to these things that I say but I think it is likely thatpatient continues to grind up and leave them in the rain and I think whats already stalked by the inflation picture of rulers how much its been impacted by currency prices so the pickup in the bench defeating 3 from headliner dentacoin playincite past it might not be the kind of waste generated inflation the the would worry the fat it is actually if you look up real wages going toSears consumer real wages are looking so healthy because the pace of wage increases as is being eroded by that inflation picture the end is nigh which means its time to playpotatoes what would you buy a like a hot cake what would you dropped like a hot potato shot it with your cupcakes at tensity while whenWrights full but it was so thats why I went the extra mile kit so if you had the environment in which right side she spiked closing that she said often I think I just hope its a side effect to trade so I canthe consumer discretionary sector has always on the phone didnt in light cycle and actually this optimism around the strength of the US consumer is a little bit worrying given all the other things that we staying in times with that displayblink of the eye I mentioned and at least interest rate sensitive sectors Im going a bit of paste withAngel Investors have a museum. Say all devices Keowee confidence in the economy between the two Im in January thisDivergence of the economy implies that that crossed should should should should go in the benefit of Australia and to continue your snowboarding theme what would be the white pegs whats your my hot potato isits been having a great time because of the tax called because your ass is doing so well but its been completely immune to everything else is going on and it just feels like the area that could go wrong if I let things go wrong I cant hold on Hill from here so Jamesfinally we come to you at your cakes cake is somewhat controversially compared to probably some of my colleagues Fuze Asian Emerging Markets I think I sent him to be to not too much they are structurally and evaluatecouches for mizewell she pick up accounts youve got potential for double rebound price in for a whileupside potential for the brexit deal so Im Im off the European Equity Market as a as a potato because it could bounce Im really worried about Europe in corporate that simply because with the macroeconomic pictures and gray continues not to be greatbrexit is a structurally structure Improvement that Im so you kind of got sentiment bouncing equities its structural and therefore Im worried about declining fortunes for European corporate so I can impress into the victim, an ecv stepping away at the end of the year.

7,8,"hello Im Richard Edgar on Facebook houses for investment professionals onlyyoure the best part of a decade of the global economy has grown and grown but the early signs of a tide may be turning if thats the case then will no longer work in the world is very differentthe one before the global financial crisis Im Richard actor and Steve Ellis had a fixed income in Europe and James BatemanChief investment officer for multi-asset Indiscreet youre old enough to remember the crisis of 2007 and 2009 but shaped your career is about your thinking six what are likeFestival is what surprised you most in the year since during the Great bull runs so I guess Im images feeling alrightrocket Landing next to the demons building watching everyone leave I just felt like that was the end of the financial services industry and actually the fact that Finance his booming maybe in different ways but actually that the industries in pretty good health whats the difference Michiganthe industry Im hot still investing was still seeing a real Equity Market was in the debt markets returns no matter she is well hes a surprise here to help from the central bankit in in in September all right you felt the end was nigh and by March 09 you were enjoying the storm to the bull market. That was quite surprising I think how quickly you know Animal Spirits began to attend Steve how about youI think the the thing is reading my surprise when sitting so 2008 has been extremely subjective nature of volatility and I think you guys bikes what youre saying Richard about the help from central banks in and its applying huge amounts of liquidity the balance sheetsdg3 Banks has increased by about 18 trillion dollars since then this provision of liquidity I think is being responsible for the very subject nature of liquidity out of that volatility brother and still has very much surprised mehavent seen more regular packs of volatility given the fact that the debt levels in the global economy now so much higher than they were even back at the 18th at the eve of the crisis by 2008 you still expect given to leverage as Bpulling up clicking culprits and balance sheet Bank some cetera that you would have seen much more periodic episodes of volatility and risk aversion but markets have been extremely resilient and durable and do near methats what we will become too because the liquidity types of being signed off right now and the cheats wild setting the Fed Up beginning to unwind spa music and raise interest rates and that could bewho is in a certain clothes and problems going down the road it was Sonya what about you what surprised you about this is remarkable. Just just fixing chemist how well we have all dayin terms of asset price inflation and I think the most striking feature to me is the fact that markets across the board including fine wine Old-Timers and any other kind of syllable SS project stunt has done particularly well and has outthe real economy that is a is a striking feature so its not only that we have jobs but how well those with jobs have done on the back of the extraordinary monetary policy support and this is why it made the most important question is if Estevez just highlighted weavenow turn off the Taps what is going to happen because we have to assume in this is something we have witnessed already and since the beginning of the year that actually markets can underperform the economy just because we have a very distinctive changed in the way we havesupported for the past 10 years that youve seen a disparity in the return from being a few blocks and yes we will have jobs.hello to countries unemployment is life but we havent seen wage inflation missing some stuff signs now but offered to the crisis is a very unusual situation 9 years on posters in triple mochaI cant wait to evolve set us up for discussion then and were like 20 now is whats the situation at the moment where do we find ourselves right now Sonia so what characterizes this particular cycle and where weat the moment the Striking feature of 2018 is the reassessment on where we on the cycle how asset asset price inflation stacks of how valuation level Steakhouse and the volatility that has started really is just to sayof this reassessment because people try to figure out whether the risk and the risk profile of the LL of their portfolio NASA location is adequate for where we on the cycle and growth might have peaked always he raises a lot of question markswe havent even touched on politics all the other headlights that after that emit round end and I really kind of raising uncertainty and in and 420 mean tweets about it anyway and expected to behave init might have done before if we go to this stage in the cycle would you see the water wubble and then the wobble to The Graduateplay some guy actually thats whats happened to see volatility that yes we have a spike in volatility but youve seen that volatility again receipt in the market so what at this point in the cycle is up there so many reasons to worry your basic valuationCrossFit circuit training Beyond me and maybe next year. Geopolitics Etc we see one pair of volatility and then we see that gradually reduce over the yet and that is absolutely a typical at this point in the cycle so if its not ajarring spasm it sounds like its going to be the critical thing he sees Katie fundamental 2 2 what happens nexttext Mary off as it transitions from congestive easing into typing QE2 cutie in reducing the balance sheet which is about four and a half trillion dollars and fried riceas well which ad was he planning to liquidity and also the huge amounts of dollar issuance of Treasury issuance the second place because of the the budget expense at the end of her life cycle and so thats drainhuge amounts of liquidity what the important thing here is Richard is that that totally quiddity is being drained in what we call the offshore total Equity Market in other words this is kind of the ureter Market which stemmed from petrodollar its the huge amounts ofliquidity which is flying around the global economy seeking yield and seeking exposure to risk assets and environment of rice of Judah fall activity but its now heading home the reason why he hasnt so far hit the US I think is thatthe same song you fight a huge amounts of dollar repressurization it because of the profit repatriation accept trip like In N Out by Trump and so if you think about the statistics are so since Aprilmoney supply M2 money supply in the global offshore. Liquidity Market is actually falling by 2.4 trillion dollars its been a huge drainage of liquidity and thats why Im not your Market sipping on December pressure is because its really turning good quality forare corporate sovereigns whooping him boring and huge amounts of dollars in the most in the US money supply that she increased by about 350 billion dollars because of that money coming back on Shore then otherwise you seendrainage from the talk show in from the energy markets back into the US money supply growth is that should be quite robust in the US and thats why youre seeing very good performance of asset prices in the US whether its investment-grade high-yield USMLExcetera but sooner or later that time. Templeton off as well and its going to be a lot more difficult for us concerts I think its not to look International that the picture its only if myto just liquid in the US could knock them of course well I think you have to have some severe Market the situation first hand weather happens in directly so another words because of whats happening in the mergingits right now which seems Frankie a very low probability that is going to derail the fed from continuing with its Fed rate hikes and bring it to the liquidity I think it has to be something on show that has two that has to happen another way to say a massivespread widening us high yield vs investment-grade which causes a very sharp tightening monetary conditions that I think thats the only thing that can really do I look fat and Sunday cruising to go on hold and stop the right hiking cycle + O2the bouncy unwind and its very possible that could be an extra if I made this is very important because I think that this is a bit of a change because I think on the power we have seen a much larger focus on on the domestic issues than beforenormally refer Bootsy how much Masa Global Central Bank at them but what power does and it will have implications because you know it it just shows the interconnectedness of day of the Global Financial system and weather likethey are indeed but the point is it always me what we focus to load on Argentina and turkey and they were locked so that would claim that their idiosyncratic risk in this trail passes and I hear this but at the at the bottom of this is still that the problem that temp Steve has just outlined inpoking about a shortage and Dona liquidity M&T you could ask the under-performance of the global banks in from an equity point of view that literally point in the same direction that Expresses in the system that so far I have only really focus on the weakest links but we should knowyou know them because they might have wider repercussions going forward for interest rate grossed as being driven Play We Ready by China James in Andresenis doubled the contribution of the US but thats might the ending because its a worthy slowing at the moment How concerned should we be sorry its a phenomenal level of Grace. For decades and secondits slowing yes but from very hard rights to still quite High rights and second grade context is the last five-year Congress the party was very clear is intended to enact policies that would solve some of the river 11/8 but at the same time would slow growth soapweedText Aaron Groth day forecast that was going to happen it happened and is happening so the real concern is not describe slope is it what could a hard Landing is it does it full below me and maybe a reasonable explanation I need my best guess is a Chinoset the Affairs of a triangle over exaggeration Ive ever accentuated party because its a very easy and popular narrative to go with because the debate really is someone choose its hard to really know whats going on when you look at trying to what you seen his is a company what is yesreal estate market see a rolling over that hes actually hes a bit of a review single bit of a rebound symbolchange then go back and take a big picture to come try and say well actually if this is what they call that second real test rasiccis but those cities with population that she about the size of London Saint. Small cities have no infrastructure yes or industrialisedIll Stand in the world in which you have a country that has cities with populations of five to ten million with no infrastructure there in the prices are rising and being used as a source of light off tonight she by the West in in in in Germanunpretentious website Traders the risk factors for a trade War how you like to Define it mean that my guess is that I can say I can make their own sometime soon place but its been broadlybut but that those crates short to medium-term downside risk but do do I believe the engine of growth is derailed if thats how you find trying to know I do not does what doesnt see itself has the the Weld Central Bankdoes China consider it has a role in global Christ Sonia was it Im purely domestically focused last time I think its something that will be redefined overdecade or so because were literally am on the edge of seeing the old kind of World Order changing quite dramatically and in that context we have the question around the world Central Bank and the reserve currency and the worlds kind of growth drive and so farits been a clearer picture on whos who this might change over time and I think were just currently if you look at the shorter-term picture always late and its big and of unknown weather and the new normal for Chinese growth I think we all agree will not provide instimulus and thats the important differentiation because it means for us from an asset valuation point if you that there might be not a new Catalyst that can we could hang our hat on and say oh wow thats great and that thats the big difference Haitian because 2m for the pastfluffy has China always provided this new stimulus where where this time around they might not do this and just accept that it will be a lower level and most sustainable level of growth and I think thats thats the big the big differentiation I think for the time being and thats moreobviously has a domestic motivation because its around OCD indebtedness and the sustainability of new debt levels M and has hence you know you probably could argue this is more domestically oriented but we have seen a much greater awareness of their responsibilities inthe florist foreign policy and their kind of position on the world stage change absolutely and sorry for the next kind of how we will see this and relationship between the US and China developHouston advertently China will be the laundry economy versus the US and Im interesting youre busy now mr. Trump seems to try to defeat the world order they have established pop and post-war so there will be lots of interesting kind of side effects that will come am about this.I think you know the point you make about transferring pool sand because when I think about the world Boyertown Institute fact is on the foot on the one hand you look at the fact the FED set the global cost of capital to fight friends right on in DirecTV10-year treasuries excetera and you know that was that interest rate differential with why the dollar so is that the US would he sets the the cost of capital I look at China and I see Chandra sexing the global Rachel Price and so the twotrending on So You Think back to 2015 when China devalues currency in August of that year and it was going through a massive Capital account reduction surgery money pulling out of China the currency was D it was depreciation rate right nowthat we did see about Sophies parking markets and by February 2016 China was in a real mess the growth was strolling they cannot lie breath to go can I go below sewer pipe essential so so they tend to Taps on a message.I need a credit expansion of a rainbow food for $10 which is what 43% of GDP in one year it wasnt busy, it was an enormous and then amazing it worked well and thats what you saw the cyclical recovery see on the one hand the fat we still mine Sunnyvale learn to trade sexual but still on type ring but it was the was China that restimulated the global economy and little boats now youre in a situation where a Chinese places you can Sterling which is not surprisinga flight to China has pretty much thats what that Im not that is growing as having less and less having diminishing returns give me less and less productive for every dollar that and so therefore is a huge mess on vacation resorts that are in trouble againso what do they do they go back to what they always do and they want to stimulate answer the question for Marcus right now is whether not China can do another pizzica and I just dont think they can I think Im so nice exactly right they spend I think they they will do everythingturn to at least mitigate the slow down but not to reach them late because the biggest Maximus the beginning of the year was his financial stability was the leveraging answer that for you know all I can do is a physical response yet but just toto really soften the blow but not to like she really stimulate Were Off to the Races again can you please mention markets and I want to move us away from the big picture we take the scene I said into how this translatesthe markets because we are in this peculiar Market at the moment the unloved Bull Run James where do we go now is there a bubble that feels it has to be popped at that stageyou never know what you are in the market cycle and see it till you cook pasta so so we will try to guess the impossible but I think you might might my starting point on that is a sorceress calitri I mean we know where am I see, Christ material accelerate thats just weird for me light cycle and we look evaluation something after from whats going on puppy light cycle conversely its been a surprise me since this is how an enjoyable this bull market has been I meananyone particularly enjoy it I lost with us around soccer is sadly but equally that hasnt been that sense of animal spirits that hasnt been that sense of excitement that hasnt been that sense old maybe this time in differentwhats the white beetle officer all is that that debate between youre saying were in the new paradigm and whenever you say that youre proven wrong and so if its entirely conceivable that we have when we look back in the antennaswhy we had a bear Market leonce will be the repricing of assets based on Isaiah Wright Forest create a stone Access Center by me put it to you all these other things I must say that shes coming because people are taking too much risk tracing you able to trace moreI definitely so bizarre a reversion is as rights rights for someone that is entirely conceivable but I think it is also entirely conceivable that we do see a. Of excess momentum in in an area of the monkey and thats the point at which you know you stop Coolinga truly serve late cycle boom that that you want to want to dearest from there is one thing I have which is Kitty in the fangs without talkin about my favorite face pleaseif you like that we should Ive ever had one that they in a way maybe I could send you a few stops but but funny actually you can you can release dateyasui right and I think that is the reason why it has not been an enjoyable Market because it was just a handful of stocks and I think its very and I dont know whether we have any historic precedent where Market leadership from a regional sector and stopspectiv has been so narrow that you have without any exposure to those you had no chance whatsoever to produce what we always be as an active manager is is called Alpha so there was very little chance to outperform the Broad and Marketand it is a sign that its a very unhealthy petrol as well because it tells me that investors are hiding in what has been perceived as kind of relative winners it clearly has worked and sandwich debated at length you know how is this going to be resolvedcan we assume thats the height of the facts are all the style of these over the in that context we have to mention that value has underperformed dramatically and growth quite obvious because if its around tech stocks its Tech sector and its theextended clip that it can only be found in in Groveton and momentum sir can we expect you know in the context of the end of cycle assumption that this is going to turn dramatically and I think here we came to theno its it can only be a negative resolution IA we have to see those segments of the US the tech sector and the thing and the bats I guess I have to include to at least Market performer underperform before we then ovenalongside hopefully New Economic cycle CM what then would be a much better value backdrop and then what we have right now but but but but then get a companies that theyre very successful companiesthe hype is not broad enough to make it kind of is hyperbolic kind of expectation that the whole Market will respond to whats the answer this last hurrah because I see them you know Ill perform yes but the point is ahavent talked about opportunities yet and the expectation that we have is at least that we should start looking at other areas because they they have been left out so dramatically which is so unusual about this last part of the interesting thing.I havent completely reconciled in my own head that you had this the last be really such a crisis this growth in in fact I stressed you smoke a lot lot of it to minimum volatility parents its a phenomenal way to money going into themand yet theyre almost the entire things because you have theoretically those are not low-volatility stocks maybe they are you got something thats only going on the biasplay strategies to my mind are people who think that buying things that dont have a lot of posted price them into that for that she will do when I download cat equation to your question of that I know its kind ofthe arrest of dissolution warnings that causes a crisis is people dont get too low risk stocks and maybe have a fangsraise people do for what they perceive is safe start because they are building income giving an income and net income but actually either that income isnt sustainable will simply so much that I still they celebrate with risk of capital lossa man and I am sorry Maria we saw earlier in the year with you have talked about it a bit the city of capitals of this world in the trillions which will come is it simply will not sustainable business models one of the things that could crack is perceived stay safe companies because they had a yield onbecause of the lack of free cash right behind them so they might might my starting point is value exponentials my view that to an extent as a picture of a to white bat mold and sunny doesnt think that. I thinkthere is a possibility of a change in leadership that says prankster underperforming other areas the market the way to money simply rotates into them and that pushes those up the second point I would just value organic Spencers in the down off yetyoure very attractive place to be with an excuse and you have to think not just where do I want to be in terms of between us and add to my mine traditional value is is the one area that could be a registered good to a position in in in in the current environmentOK Google come to positioning for Fordyce in the potential that whatever comes next in and of the wild it Im Steve let me come to you if we go to all these distortions and peculiar behavior in the eczemacredit I think they hating Darren whats it what is the transition that youll sing at the moment well in the last 4 years in credit markets is being hunt for yield and thats being perpetuated by very low interest rate environment soon and Justinto find some kind of form of Fame return and its generally come from from the years rather than sight from generation excetera and I think were getting to the point where now is interest rates are going higher is going to make itdifficult stats in a way still in a very low volatility environment so people are still hunting for yield at least for the time being but the the we seen quite resilience in some markets in particular in US high yield investmentI must have aniversario because your Frankie is after the reasons I mentioned earlier in the US you seen the you seen my coming back on Shore in some money supply is being Real Steel robots and US supplies being very very loudthe u.s. cellular market so Ive been actually quite surprised as how was it in states where is all the parts which is Emerging Markets you seen a very large sell-off in Sprite and you seen quite sharp dislocation in this market in the inevitable there in the USdate the key question for credit investors in a fixed-income investing in general and is really what happens next year its normally the FED is the Catalyst for Market Corrections in every every cycle ends becauseand the risks that you know you look whats priced in now for the side we are now at 2% fed funds Target right now we got Seahawks pricing for this year and one-and-a-half next year so its a FedEx she continued through and then she deliver on thisMikes we can have fed funds rate closer to 3% so thats going to be as your Hudl right is now going to be higher and higher and the question is does this site she pushed the us over the top of the age does that she generates session because he Frank see if you lookhigh yield spreads in Crossville marketing investment right for that matter we had a very virtuous cycle in the last 10 years or so youve had a very low interest rates and very low yield so that she made it very easy to refinanceIm its a huge amount of liquidity and now as interest rates are getting higher and liquidity is now being drained the Huddle right smoke it and get more more difficult for Sorenson for corporates to to to refinance to The Virtuous cycle you think ofthe number is zombiefied companies in the world that is being renewed many studies looking at some the reason why theyre still an ongoing concern is still that she trading is that just by virtue if I live in Detroit today the ability to refinancein any of the normal circumstances I would have gone bust were having to call me which is hugely unproductive because all the provision of very low interest rates and said that keeping afloat but that can read that for now but I can unwind if you see Tres Rios meeting hiring fed funds right moveand hes going to get more more difficult for them to refinance the nuts Im going to Virtual cycling to turn into a vicious cycle did I say that theres already a signal path from the feds but theres a risk of Central Bank policy mistakesI also think about Whittle schedule but we havent which could be on the on the rise Royal has risen dramatically over the past year Ive been getting to see wages rise in the USIm how does that change the dynamic wage rises in the u.s. no swiping very subdued up until now but now with labor markets appearance be quiet tonight it could be that is like pulling in a brick on the floor with that elastic band you something to eat nothingfor a long time then suddenly the the Brick masonry rapidly and you know we could see a very sharp spike in wages here and you look at some you look at things like that surveys and you look at the Atlanta fed survey in placemuttations the United it does show that core inflation is going to be fire in the US and if thats the case then decide how to act they have to tighten they have to keep progressing with Fed rate hikes and thats the problem is that in place ifplay some is indeed in the system I like I just Im not quite convinced my mind whether or else it is because I do think there are some powerful disinflation forces in the global economy as well but if if the US inflation is pushing Jolla this in the short timeit means that the FED will have to ignore Tina they will have to just carry on with the two tiny of the balance sheet and a Fed rate hikes and that Im afraid could I see the direction to. Of stagflationI mean Im clearly merchandise is from a lot of discussions weve had the big worry about inflation for the Galaxy as one of my colleagues at me recently will be right in the end you just got to why is thatbut youre an end and Steve is just won the prize for the best analogy of the year for blue suit inflation is wore it to me because he faced many factors that weve had over the past20 + years have ended in your first wedding EMG player as a source is it certainly less acne and this is the big one to me I dont believe the internet is is is a is a device me. I didnt eat internet is a price discoveryand prices have been discovered so you had a. Of deflation impact because everyone could ascertain the cheapest price for anything and that ended ended. She dont got sticky prices menu cost because of the internetrisk of the risk is that if we had one of the week is a seeing the cost Ruth cost increases which cost increases Cartwrighthes crazy to do that in a rapid cycle you see a connection isnt doing it you do it it it becomes a vicious cycle of a price and wage inflation Im saying the risk of inflation getting high is it will be 30 - 24 plus 10 plus years Im is really thatadd pussy to that is inevitable to a very different central-bank situation is very different monetary approach Sonia where are the opportunities lie in themlike this think before identifying opportunities is very important that these adjustment processes will be with us for a long. Of time so we have to be very Nimble and very mindful that this is not done in a quarter suggest but you know speaking ofpre-market so did the immediate reaction function yes can be very short-term but there will be an ongoing reassessment of what actually opportunities are and how we should look Im at these in the context of a potential and final stage of the cycle changing monetarylets see if this extreme Market leadership so that thats kind of the framework we we try to put in place before then starting to say okay what where do we feel we should start looking for good opportunitiesto stop with all the sectors had to have been dramatically left behind and where we feel that actually we have sufficient visibility on the business model of the cash flow the earnings stream and where there has not been a massive buildup in leverage against her another framework to look at individualthe nice list this is obviously the dividend yield and well play a different angle because if we look at the importance of the dividend yield than this is well-documented over the long-term interesting Lee over the last five years weve had a much larger contributionthe multiple expansion that we had from unexplored and dividend yield if we agree that because of the changes from QE to QT that will not at least repeat itself than the dividend Diaz and the earnings growth will be much moreto determine the attractiveness of underlying stocks and that means that if I look at him some of the Left Behind sectors and again the most important part is to not buy just the years you buy the business model you buy the extreme and the cash flow and if that comes with apercent dividend to you too my mind is a very good starting proposition because in our own Capital Market assumptions 5% is pretty good and say this is what we really started to look at and gives you a good idea on where the opportunities are and you wouldntbe surprised that is quite a few companies in those Left Behind sectors which I think are now a good starting proposition to look at it because they should provide you with more stability in what will be inevitably and much more uncertain environment please as I saidreassessment and the Readjustment purses will be with us for quite some time good individual stories in utilities but againbe mindful Rising interest rates Bond proxies sex is Left Behind todays lots of things to to capture hens what we said for it for a number of of months now that we see the active selection is key to your success going forward but Hennessy not having a goodframework on what youre looking for and what you assume is going to be the changing environment will help you guys you and navigate the market backdrop if your chances are thinking fixing can youit is pretty simple and I think the biggest opportunity right now is more in the short duration Income Tax Strategies where you know youre trying mitigate some of the the risk from rising Hills and and Anna by having a short duration type ofthe funds exposure but also you still need the income and Us in as a key thing for many investors as I took it very much a defensive type of stress you but still generating sufficient income to two unit provides that they to return the investors requirewhat strategies you deploy now that you want a little while ago how are things not changing in multi-asset betta and earto contact one of these are the things we learned from 07 was getting out this way too many moving to passive R7 Master be disillusioned and Ill write you do not want to be passive light cycle in the in most markets because the the the bike because returns can becomeBattleship museum Downtown that Ive seen you want to start in the holding tax II there about 4 that I really want to focus on these is what kind of tips and it would be at whether its normal short Equity market-neutral Etc strategies the underlined or the direction in the markets generatorset alarm to skill of awesome or trying to get this time because they are immune from Market changes immune from these environments provided the underlying managers are making the right decision and therefore Im not allowed to Alpha in both those areas isis rain important I just hadnt cleared of course that would like to go is it hurt Peter areas of the market Villa I said leasing or in Social infrastructure Etc areas where you can you can invest in a pizza in Cincy the Rize pizza but its notcorrelation to equities. Forget it just brought you some immunity from those traditional asset classes where there are some natural concerns at this point in the cycle varietyI will wait wait we come to the end now I just want to go to each of you what keeps you up at night its being this long Bull Run its being old but I havent been bad Sonia what where is heMarket still show towards the idea that we had we are facing a regime shift the idea that we have very used to the support from central banks and massive amounts of liquidity supporting Alexa classes I think we we havejust seen the first inklings of what might be ahead of us and I think we have to be very it just wear and a Nimble to make sure that were not missing what might be quite profound shift things what about you will keep you up sothings this is what sounds Richard specifically in the I think will really worries me is is invested dissolution and in what weve seen since the fence prices is the millennial generation assumption not participating the stock market by saying its notI will always be in the in the next bear Market is those investors which is the majority of the population across the world who have participated in this bull market have invested become disillusioned because they bones which state receives a sitePappasitos as yes because I want to tell you because I thought it was generous turns out not to be as safe as I thought they were generation was seeking an income there was a risk for Capital loss and that thiswe could meet in the next cycle the same as much money on the table cuz not many people would start to deploy money in in in in traditional markets about that maybe thats why the most when we see about him or he could have a big psychological impactcome to you lost time I noticed that the glass in front of you on the on the table here is half empty from a fixed-income point of view what keeps you up well I am I doconnect four by four a nation we tend to be more the better side I I think thats the biggest risk of me and what keeps me up at night is when I mentioned that you would eat this subdued nature of all to go see Im not saying you got the invitation. Suicidewhen is an asinine should we do you know we stress us a fun so we the funds will assume that the low volatility environment will persist and so I disrespectful to the dusk bike that could cause some happy once every assassin and twoIris concerts will it once and I think the deal setting while the thing that makes things worse is that the technicals in the market very very difficult to sell because its a very small occipital with some of the two kinds of parties the banks know the wayhaving a much lower panel sheet elements and their full day its going to be its too liquidy that they provide to us and is it going to be much less so if we do see the volt bike is results of the fat neck stiffness of the edge with fried ricelike some training should the liquidity it could be a very small exit office to get higher self everythings freezing out well between you I think you give me enough to worry about it tonight but Ill take comfort from the areas that way you will think there are opportunities inin the months to come as we come to the end of this great running let me think no Steve at as head of fixed-income and p.m. thank you very much in teethIm listening to more on this topic and I latest edition of the jealousy ounces just Google goodbye this podcast is for investment professionalKylie and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switch to send it must not be reproduced or any other party without Pride formation of fidelity the value of investmentplay down at the weathers up so you may get back less than you invest all the important legal notices please see our website professionals.

8,9,"hello Im Richard Edgar and this podcast is for investment professionals onlythe percent of population is changing in many places especially the developed by having fewer children but the living longer sometimes too many for that comes to find workyouve probably heard all this before its not a surprise but what did these huge shift mean for societies and for investors what challenges are there for government businesses and individuals how to support or employ the old the Younghow did Hela cells with me in the studio to discuss the demographics of three Fidelity expert first David Buckle head of investment Solutions design here at Fidelity job is to think in novel wayshow people can fund their retirement whats the most significant shift that youve seen in the way the industry is approaching this by far the most significant is the notion of needing to invest in the retirement face as opposed to cashing out THCthought in other words that thats not a done deal youre going to carry on trying to recoup some returns for the many years that many people who are retired military pension since you live too long and therefore the money doesnt lossit needs to grow at least through the first phase of retirement to make sure it lost for the rest of your life time with me also is consumer funds next Imagine Thattheory is that you, complement each other the impact of changing populations and their behavior interesting Trend that touches both of those I think trans is how people today in the fifties thing that they are still young and how they spend their money so we all talk about aging and we all talk about the population declining the spending power declining but I think psychologically people areyounger and I might younger older and youre responsible for and pension schemes of1 million and investors all over the world are the needs of those members evolving they are changing in light of what we saying in terms of the global demographics of changes I need the most fun.so thing is that people now have their own responsibility for their retirements I think the shift is clearly moved from state to ease of the private individual or deterrentits something people are not recognizing they need more support and help to save for retirement income so a lot of people are having to get their heads around Julian David NSA welcome to you oldcould you set the scene for us please what challenges do the demographics pose in places which are getting older yes thats two big ones the first one thats thats when you retire you have to find them to the point of your daythe longer you live the more the moneys got lost. Thats the clear driver in demographics and because that face is actually quite shortened in the sense of a lifetime just a few years extra longevity actually been quite a Big Eback to the work your savings have to do the second thing is is a question mark about how much the state can provide with the demographic shift of how many young people are supporting how many old people its not clear how much pension division can come from the states in the futuregenomics underpin or does this affect those points to go making helpful actually under the economic growth is how many people working and how much is each one producing at the population growth of the world is slowing so theres less peopleAlice greczyn people say we need them to be more productive and with an aging population actually typically that corresponds to a lower productivity poor productivity it is a symptom singing many economies particularly these are theseaccording to the growing older but yes and demographic shifts are you looking for the good newsDefine radiates and the most exciting news isadd that all the people will have to spend money on that basically trying to stay younger and healthier longer and this very clear Transit the medicine technology that many companies.Foot Solutions the Baby Boomers retiring Baby Boomers have very high spending power and as I said before they think they are young they want to enjoy their life and intend to spending patternsSting from Alves from a finx which I may be necessary to Finks which I may be much more discretionary that allow them total to enjoy life and and and and stay stay healthy and fitthe types of things that you were looking for where do you specifically start to sort of pick up Im on those those changing Trends sell something which is maybe a big beneficiary of a of a jbecause us as we know as we hope that skin care products to help us looking younger and and Ive seen studies that show a lady in the 50s buys five times more.JD Hoyts in her twenties so obviously companies that sell skincare products are quite quite the clear beneficiary but they just men in their twentiesgo to metrosexual men who care about what they look like a lot of Asia we are saying crossing the month for men for skin care and this is driven past the also by social media why you wants to trybacteremia trying to look young so we are seeing quite a chunk trend on up Grove but its not the Baby Boomers I think it would be the generation of Millennials as they got all that you will spend more on Mount skin careIm dying to ask you about your your skincare regime and your your your social media profileactual living longer that feeling younger Im staying longer in work and how are the companies having to to adapt to an aging Workforce yeah I think I think the science tensionvolume benefit to employees particularly as you know the age that work forces the more experienced by definition they can bring to that organization and I think note hiring young Talentbe quite challenging into an organization Service hiring in your senior more experienced talent I think is also important so what we saying a lot of laundry employees in particular having a much more flexible approach intoall of the night when people would I expect to be retiring they are designing that benefit structures in a way that accommodates an older Workforce as well so I think employers I absolutely understandthis however to Davids earlier points that probably comes a point in time where the older generation become less productive so equally employees dont want an aging Workforce it is becoming less productiveI want to make sure that they are financially secure so they can actually retire at an appropriate age and not just to have to continue working for income purposes I see faces in elementary education as welljust at the companys Im bit of the employees as well in the u.s. is this concept to financial Wellness so I think historically employeespretty focused on what retirement savings and making sure that that work forces are adequately K24 for otamatone come but I think increasingly whether its for the older generation or indeed the younger generation this concertall Financial well-being Financial Wellness Beyond retirement another wise beyond for Thomas saving so whether that song short-term cash flow management youll familys Financial Wellness as wellseeing employers set up these programs to inform and engage with a Workforce on this broader topic of financial Wellness into every training as well I mean unlockedgiven that this is over at the same time as a technological Revolution its unlikely that people have a single career for this Force life span so the likelihood of Nintendo switch games McCreerys becoming greater and these Milestones that when I waswolffer how close are you to retirement point you will probably need to check those milestones at the same time and potentially shifting gave in your career how do we pay as acountries economies how do we think about paying to people in their retirement because that has to change as well yes this is typically three pillows switch people lean on on the first is to stay the second is to company the Thursday in theIm State stepping back in many faces yes you just look at that the shit numbers the number of people retiring the number 90 on the balance sheet and then its like thats going to have to shift Sunday isnt ityou save a planning for retirement I dont want to rely on that government places a significant part of my retirement yeah I think I think the state clearly plays a really really important role in Russiapredation particularly for the less well-off and I think what were saying is this shift from governments focused on good quality adequate State provision for the lowest paid and then formedium to high paid individuals putting more emphasis on them to say for the Run retirement become less reliant on the state so he knows quite an important shift but I think overall this is a fact that actually stateyou want the governments countries do you want to backtrack a little bit on this provision that side if I was used in the absolute amount of retirement income that the state provides or often and increasingly increasing the age when you become eligible to take those betterso Trumps favorite responsibility to individuals but at the same time as a transfer of risk from the companies that were providing defined-benefit schemes to defined-contribution Sir. So people to get my head around itin this preparation I I think its just started in reality I mean this move from defined benefit guaranteed retirement income to defined contribution is really been involved in the last 20 years but I think the reality isin a lot of the countries in particular that are countries that actually are the concept of defined-benefit is more less disappeared a lot of people say well thats a negative thing but actually can be postedsafely bring it back to the demographic changes and the flexibility that the workforce is looking for actually having defined contribution can be a significant Advantage so if example in retirement we know thatyeah when you just retire you posted. Youll have your health you need to enjoy your free time you need more money so you need a higher income at that point in time and then as you become older actually you less mobile and propane have lessbut you did say to enjoy your free time and you need less money than the third and final so the cycle actually as you go into later life you perhaps have less could help you need health carecan I spend more money at the end where is the defined benefit plan by definition gives you a pretty static level of income throughout your retirement okay Im done these are the persons and I said that you were talking about how youre trying toSports where the opportunities are fast but this aging at this point in time is most eBaby Boomers smoking still kind of a bit more advanced age thats thats not cold at all day and its a time where they say they still have a lot of saving spending power and at winning us to spend and enjoy the life anime be therethinking so far had but Elsa this is the population that has a lot of lot of in the houses they have experienced to the global housing boom and they have quite a lot of money saved in in in the mine or Saturdayso just need to question planning forwards from debt for them is when they get into the eighties will they be able to run east Equity from the house and use that to pay for the advertisement on for the for the for the car that they wantso I think people in the late sixties and not yet so concerned about the danito to actually have sightings at night maybe thats thats unfair responsible and that part because the time flies quite fastgeneration. Cohort have gauze assets and this is quite different time to people who are following them and they are also the people who tend to vote and I just want to bring in governments here Im David becausethe problem in sorting out some of the fundamental issues Im around here is that the that the Electoral cycle is too fast for anybody ready to cross the Nephilim and and and make some of the painful changes the pastbe done yes thats correct yes these the cycle of retirement is way longer than the cycle of election as we get older and older Society they represent a bigger and bigger group that the governments ofset to Panda to to win votes about pensions State pensions actually havent been around for that long and when they started you received it when you are 65 and the expected lifeBensi was 49 that was really designed for people who unexpectedly lived on so the notion of you retire with still 15-20 years of life left and you do cruises and golfing holidays new life things that was never reallylandfill in from the governments perspective so what is the answer that we we we realize that some things arent as good anymore and people like you give me a quote to work until I mid-seventies me daisies will Beyondbut more importantly if youre able to save stop saving that thats the most important message this about doing it wellthis isnt it pretty well because when you talk to other governments and instead of policymakers often they are referring back to the UK as a potential model to fall outside for examplehe died in the UK we still have very very generous levels of contributions that you can make into a pension plan with full tax relief there are exceptions you know if you get paid lots of money then you know it gets scales back foot for the vast majority of peoplestill on a relative Global comparison basis very high levels of contributions with tax relief I think I know what they say that the governments by introducing overtime Romans has been seen to be very Progressive this because this is now brought a lothe pulled into the workplace retirement environment which they would intervene in prior to that and then fine. I would just say that these days when you retire in the UK you have complete flexibilityhow you wish to receive your income so I think thats hot political consensus in the UK all of the political parties are behind it it is a very long time strategy by comparison we see other countries Huluthe tax relief or limit contributions because of the cost to the State Hearing now Robin taking a long time. Do you start looking at where you think people are going tomoney to spend in retirement another example might be Australia where they go to a well-funded system that does that sort of decision play thinking about it but I must say its very hard becauseat the end of the day its about how people make their choices and most of consumption globally is actually from wealthy people the most of the opportunities to invest in consumer-facing businessesis catering to the wealthy people as as as all as we all know they control most of the stock equities day they control most of the housing assets and this is why I figured it out for their consumption and also for the concertand some two wolves that they would be passing on to that children is quite healthy the issue is definitely when it comes to two people that have not saved that are not planning for the future and this is majority of the population and that will have implicationscompanies that sell products that cater to that level of population so I do think about it but aggregated phases is it doesnt look as bad as it might seem on Everett kind of per capita basis once again a nice positivegive me an example of some of the countrys been to our appealing to you at this broad level we are looking at the Dependency Theoryand that helps us to identify country swag for the long-term the opportunity of consumption is very good because the ratio of those who dont work to those who are in the in the working force is is good and stable over timeLisa number of countries Vietnam is a good example of India is a very good example Indonesia but most of the countries in the developed world I mean Japan is needing the park about the Aging of Western European countries isits fast enough to see the same applies to China us actually has quite a good demographics and it is being mother of two beasts by the entire immigration policy now this country still has quite the sense demographics andand as a result quite a good outlook for consumption but some of the countries that you highlighted their the Emerging Markets they are a differentbackground different type of place to to invest with different challenges as well as to how do you how do you factory order those things in when youre thinking about many years in advance so I can get them which has very young populationcountry. Today actually benefits from the fact that a lot of the factories are being moved from China while I was becoming too expensive partially as a result of scarcity of Labor in a China to Vietnam and youSedum the creation of jobs at the low and moving Toto Toto two more sophisticated Hyatt vario and jobs and as a result what we are saying companies like Zara going downshopsins Ann and having a big success as always think that story played out in many countries before and we can see that happening in the next decade or a middle-class more spending and what have youwe seen it all before David the question I want to ask you is the countries that have the demographic dividend at the moment so theyve got people in the lower age brackets are they simply going to be places with a problem in inis to come in the same way that Japan is at the Forefront now and developed markets I am like they say Germany choosing one thats about to have a problem in Europe trying to design products for these differcountries is its more to do with the cultural expectation of how retirement is managed so for example in the western world is becoming to have some kind of Life annuity products which pays you an income through retirement and then when you diebut I tell you that where is in parts of Asia where I speak to the response from consumers there is to say that we dont need that much money in retirement because theres an expectation that your family takes care of you but it wouldnt be acceptable to have thatand that nest-egg disappear on that they are they playing the match then transfer to those little ripped off to you as part of your estate so managing the cultural issues tend to be a bigger problem than that the demographic that you refer to so emotionalwe supposed to develop a product that you didnt have three for those markets with a lump sum payment at the end free sample and potentially lower income through retirement to compensate withmore attractive to did some of the Asian countries GMU you think about this from a global point of view as well and on on the business side so howwho is adapting that maybe operation notes of countries yes I mean we are seeing these Global multinational companies wanting to increasing you have aches with consistent Cullmanapproach to retirement provision and the broadest of financial provision for that work for a site to Davids point it is very different country by country in Sons of State provision but actually these employers want moreso they want more fanis more equality across all of that work. Im at a particular US based organizations are putting more work force and increasing thatspray for outside of the US so increasingly they all coming to Fidelity and asking us for help with Solutions in these Emerging Markets whether Im now actually employing quite large volume of of employeesis it enough time to start bringing about change in those markets past acceleration some of the developments that Im already happening in the developed iconic I dont think its going to bechange but what I do know is the governments and States pay close attention to all these multinationals are doing you know how often they are incentivizing these companies to set up businesses in these locations and they watch very closeplay how the employee vest off and what benefits they provide so I think this will be very much something which will drive change through these large companies and I change programs to different change into governmentuntil you and I need to State as well that youre seeing in the way individuals are able to start thinking about the way that they sell at the beginning of your careerit just seemed so far away at most people dont want to think about. Increasing Lee both individuals and their employer is given a lot of thought to this and really thinking perhaps talking to somebody and thencan somebody in their ready 20 is about a 2 or even 5 your time Horizon and suddenly not a 30-40 a Time Horizon so for example it may be about this little short on cash flow this with moneydebt increasing that she student debt on a global basis is becoming an issue we often think about it as an issue here in the UK be sunny an issue in the US as well and I think increasingly what employers are looking for a whats a simple effective wiringkitchen without Workforce whether its only a short medium or long time Horizon for that Financial well-being so as an example we have come up with some sort of co-principals what we couldnt retirement guidelines and onephases example is what we refer to as the savings backed up so what multiple of your annual salary do you need to save at a particular age to make sure that you can retire on a adequate incomeIran track that Im at Milestones that youre going to be okay once times your annual salary as a cash equivalent you need to Authority save your time its if youre in your thirties it made before timesNew 52 probably going to be closer to 8 or 9 times so very simple way as you say if people just making sure that they remain on track and we can deliver this service in this information in a easy to easy weight losssafe example through a mobile app or on the web site so to use of Technology comes into play because I think increasingly people want just an easy simple intuitive way of accessing information realoil changes then right across the board and innocent thank you so much for joining me and Frankiefor listening this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the passno entity switch to send it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investment think I down at the weather that so you may get back less than you invest all the important legal notices please see our website professionals.Odyssey.

underwear that seemsokay let me come to you because you ignored him with great conviction around the move to Mutual in the UK was it nothing but basically on the equityI did what Ive been through what Ive done in my songs by recently is that is actually at to equities because sentiment is so I sold that I do wonder whether we could see a ride up into the air right James mention valuationsif you look at the situation X leading the us then the major markets are trading on about 13 times next year and if Grace has a big ass if Grace isokay reasonable for the next 6 to 12 months then perhaps you could actually see your Riley inequities on the back of those valuations and so I just felt like giving the sentiment was so negative just woken up Trinity to make some moneytwo different views on fixed-income you werent happy with a neutral everything on the exhaust is head of this meeting and little bit more positivebouncing and have it ready change that for you I would love to sympathy with the appointment next raised around sentiment on the face short-term basis being quiet overdrive assault and I would see that as an opportunity because I started from to cover base about show up at 2 stillhey on the way because I do think that that the grace back up that way looking at these is is vulnerable to just letting again and the technical signals that we guessing Sunday from from the muzzles of pretty mixed on a short-term basis so inclined to think Marketlongtime event turn signals are quite negative risk assets and unsupportive of bums and quite a bit but to what extent is brakes at the mines if take the group generally he sanksome Xavier Ruud achiever I think its bad to say happy tears and to not take a strong view because because things the same flux and I think as this is so changeable I will probably be outdated by the end of this book costhes having on you and you thinking about answer to say what what am I saying like this deal no deal right around outside my own sensesI markets are under estimating the probability of an idea thats not say that I think that Nigella at the base case it just says I think the Markets a hundred preciate that to the question for me is someone who has been more negative on UK its when do you start to close byappreciated do you have a base case around brakesSophie went out when the kids decisions I think I stopped by the oceans and the UK Market touch with you when I meet from managers they talked about price large-cap and small-capstocks biggest Chief is a scene for a year is enough for that may be a reason for that at some point you start looking at a company toast valuation and earningsSpanish flea pricing in Providence, getting but suddenly recession levels Im when they stop processing in that sort of outcome then you kind of think enoughs enough and Im so I dont have a Baton Rouge but if it gets worse its definitely time to go by for what interesting the kids at the bubble as we sit around this tableGeorge St-Pierre coverage of brexit in prime ministerwhere is giving a statement to the yet to the House of Commons hate consuming attention here in the UK youll based in Hong Kong people in Asia word than my colleagues in in London Englandwe had a discussion about brexit I didnt contribute much other than saying that Ive been having a lot of meetings with clients and investors in the past 2 years ol around Asia Hong Kong Singapore and many other placesthey have never asked me about brexit thats the way that is playing from an investment pointyou could still have ramifications can take could be the source of trigger that that that might send shockwaves around lockers for sure a lot of things I can actually go wrong this isshe one of them that could trigger myself across Market that is a possibility with did see that happen on the back of the referendum 2 years ago show so yes it can happen but the way I would approach about social scenarioit was to materialize is that I would look at other areas that would have sold off as a result it was a woodwind packed it as a result of brexit risk of notable Resco and actually pretty interesting find Opportunitiesglass half full kind of guy however you said there were lots of other things that could be tricky situation of things should we be worried about Im instead of North brexitaggressive recommendation the US especially one thats driven by real rates Rising I think thats been a key element for for Market where is today and I guess you know I do live in in Asia China Slowdownused we have to keep monitoring how much further this goes and to what extent is some sort of a new federalism policy that is a bit more meaningful for Photo Market suddenly my glass is half-empty again to thinkI think you are such that you wonder whether I see the interpretation ofI dont take this one on the UK is its somewhat paucity issue which is that actually will save some surrounded by brexit we think everyones on to Whiteplay some people have them ready whos faster. Martin and maybe that is all still to come Im probably never sets Ill probably the UK and brexitit is not something thats going to watch Logan investors but actually if the UK attend turned around with that a successful deal then the impact that would have had on Europe would have been something was wrong about because populist partieswithin of had a catalyst to really step up and put pressure on the commission Im pulling out of Europe in the Euro and the indications that would have had but I think its out till I think that is so its very difficultsee anybody else wanting to join us governments willingness to provide stimulus if and whenyoure exciting as a hard one because its always been willing to switch to manage the economy and I thought she done so quite frequently I thinking it might there were two concerns I have that one hes on the impact of stimulusactually transmitted through FX fuel weather for verace reasons a transmission isnt isnt at The Goonies Fat Tony they tried to stimulate in and you see a swollen by the second in the given the global economic context Kevin Hart weve had to take 10 years of ageI do wonder whether Chinas thinking you know the risks to overheat also migrated lyrics to slow down and try to steal great bus is most of the world is going to remind it probably how much do they rateIm if we look at you stole it back yet the few years ago that the last five years, read the whole message was we want to slow growth and redistribute income off at 3 but you have a new rule thats so early in doing that. It is so much more to do that is actually about slowing aggregate price so Im Im not as convinced as a some people that the government wants to take too many steps to to to to boost growth from here by one of your colleagues just came back from a trip to Chinahe was impressed I think if I have Dem beats up people with a t specs I went for a run all his conclusions because I know hein the midst of writing a lot but I think broadly as a sort of how it look at their the Chinese dates are and I know you like that with the sentiment that hes come back with a yes very sweet 16 some stabilization in infrastructureprivate consumption and real estate is is like hes loving and continuing to save very weak retail sales about stud retail sales vehicle sales that dont come back to that kind of label cost a sight on that weve been talking about I know saysunlight take to soften and so bad as some of these type starts kicking in that kind of front running Fades out so very hard to call the bottom in Chinese great hair I think whether we have the point of a piece of stabilisation we Stan be acceleratedit hasnt quite quite possible policy-makers are not yet in a place that they alreadyready to do any kind of big bang similar Sentiments of the sea and an announcement and it may be that that thatgoing to register the policymakers do to respond in a more meaningful way but they dont feel like we there yet so touching the reasons to be pessimisticchange your social giving signals that is being as well as cell on the Peaksis it as a group we havent agreed that and I think that there are differences between different Pams and I think that might be time Horizon you know Im not convinced in the next 2 or 3 weeks we can see how a break out. Woodson markets but what does worry me is this decided that the average professionalpasta is is bearish and the average Russian investor is worrying about Im the fat where the end of the cycle and markets have a tendency to have a lost her all the people miss out on they can be quite major in X about side and your what we have to be prudent and not take too muchI am aware that you know but I still think its probably a 19 x t a scenario of a tone 20% off moving in equities isnt my base case by any means but its a possibility I might want to bet too strongly against that would be the moment that you knowits game over for the cycle make make some comparisons and one of those could be the Asian crisis what I should round ltcm the factthey cut write 75 basis points and you go to your body and asked hes so its hard to lay out to happen we have to have all these areas that could play out and cuddle to you please delete whichever wayI think its very difficult at the motel cynical but then if you look at such a nice actress is there is definitely find you so weve been buying into a Shahi old emerging-market thats because when youyields of seven or eight percent thats a great starting point Im with inequities I still like to put Japanese equities because they have I think theres a visit this a good micro and macro story you had such an interesting idea about hedge fundsand how theyve been performing and what they might do next is typically had a pretty shockingIm waiting to have a pretty show me up type of looking at them is taking a big directional back a big lossI need to make that looks back and then I will make that lost back my not having positions on so what am I might my kind of question is whether youre going to see a weight of money from from hedge funds throwing itself into an area of the male cat damones just pushing out and I do wonder whetherits going to be us value of Valium or more generally but I think there is at least an hour of the market you could just see the slew of money coming in rapidly of time so Im excited to take some hot potatowould you buy a like a heart cake emoji drop like a hot potato shot it has come to you once you are hot cakes please us is more likely to slay the next cellerate hairSunday that says supplies had twins but I think ultimately without Gales probably for BG fall in that environment and at the same time you had an easing and inflation Patches at least at the margin off the back of a pretty significant bacon oil and I think thats itI sodi isometric position at this stage that play on the the the witness that were seeing instatalk to space and say like what I got cake cake when I mention invention financials which is generally generallysearch for Europe and Japan look very cheap indeed but thats it thats the attraction is devaluation the unloved financials arent they always got to the US dollar justfundamentally looks expensive any signs of the US slowing and well see the US dollar weakening time to go to the fetus agree with Nick hair is its us valuevalue stocks on margin initials of the body shop of this cycle in the US so so so that would be no cake and then whole potato I think I said this last time but its got to be sillyIm really worried about aliens and the government tension with the EU was that suppose I wish you could just make it your advice in Italian.

Whats the IMO suggestingthe moments the armor with imposed limits on sofa corner of fuel pump free not sent from the 1st of January 2020 they will reduce this limits to 0.5% so thats a really big drop is it going to be atinternationally because yes its the only I know the international Maritime organization but some of the countries like China just the one that hasnt had a threesome are they on board40s and Im expecting in Folsom level to be relatively High. I believe now that it will be up to the ports for states to enforce these rules so ships that are complying with the rules and wont be able to talk for San Jose?what about insurance of the ships will hold if theyre not complying with the regulation so I think thats enforcement levels will be high like a pole Why do ships use this fuel is so horrific Lee policingdirty secrets thats when you get a barrel of oil has to go through Refinery and the refinery produces a bunch of stuff that we consume is can you so it could be gasoline actually recorded in Europe to be dieselthen theres some products that no one really wants so high sulfur fuel oil hsfo is it cold is one of these products that comes out of Refinery that no one really wants and sludgy its the same power lyricsschnapps Tissot on the list of unwanted things its kind of dead with asphalt as well comes out of a refinery in and goes on the roads so its a product that no one really wants it makes it seem so cheap in fact that if you took a barrel of oiland could seriously converted into a barrel of high sulfur fuel oil and its you lose money it is go to negative profit margin so its his very undesirable and as a result is used in placeno ones going to complain about it so the other side of a resting starts out that is that in petrol the sofa company is 20 parts per million in this high sulfur fuel oil marine oil is 35000 parts per millionso its nasty its horrible at the moment its used in the middle of the Pacific and the Atlantic with no ones going to complain so we didnt break it I should know Im how are they shipping companiesto have to adapt to this so slow at level of cellphone in the in the fuel are they going to use a different fuel or change the ships in the same way that for cause when unleaded fuel withthe engines changed the Marine industry uses around 3 million barrels a day of high sulfur fuel oil so their number choices easiest one is they could cheat are they completely ignored the rulescan you burning this myself a few loyal but then the risk of of sanction and fines I think most of them will do is just switched to diesel which is a Louis sofa fuel the other choice that they could have is to installscrubber on the vessel that basically takes the most hes out of this myself a few little issues is that what is being burnt its its its taking the exhaust is that right yes I believe it is off to the Bone.imperfect solution as well because often what tends to happen is the sulfur just gets dropped in the ocean so its not a complete solution to the problem it just kind of meat you can take the box and say we comply with the rules its a just twostraight then you taking it out of the exhaust fumes so its not going up into the sky is his money back to him that but youre bypassing that Stephen and Sophia Sophia doesnt really help thingstypes of technology so you can have closed loop and open-loop scrubbing so it depends what kind of Kit you put on the vessel but I think the reality is is it most shipowners you dont want send a fax ideally on socall question marks at the moment in terms of the exact timing are they going to be waivers for some country some shipowners movies on certainty is that have leading a number Sheboygan its going to hold back and say Well lookwait until we get that at no point investing in a particular type of scrub a knife if we dont know whether thats that rule is still going to hold in a cup of your tent and I think were doing is that looking at the costwhat is the cost of buying more expensive diesel versus spending many millions of dollars on a scrubber on the vessel I think at the moment were in a situation whereby yes there is some investment be announced but lots of people going to holding back as welland if the the shipping companies to I think the vast majority of shipping company so far indicated that they will go down the route of burning low sulfur fuel foot from TexasDeadpool mentions and it is Elizabeth from capex cost for insulin pumps most interesting aspect of the scrubber is actually if you do in economics of doing so can actually be quite compelling in terms of the costexample buy liquor a company that I cover called CMA CGM so they they burn save 8 million tons of fuel per year which is about 16,000 tons a year if you multiply that by the the price differential between high and low sulfur fuel 4 million-dollar to TCM roughly average cost of a scrubber so we have very very short payback. On your investment if you are to go down that route and I think we need to pull mentioned why companies are popularfluorescent to do that Im all definitely valid but status on my view is it sunny for the first move is in the adult in scrubbers they could be Im quite nice pretends to be madeeither way theres going to be more cost for the shipping companies either they going to be paying more for more expensive fuel or theyre going to have to pay iTune in contempt of this water thing rarely stops withDavis investing against post on somewhere else but lie to people like you and me its all I estimate of costs in the region of 1460 billion dollars per year for the shipping companies of complying with these new regulations so you have to be like the cost260 billion thats right so it was an enormous amount when you consider the operating margins of shipping companies warty very low the fuel costs are around 15% of their operating costs so if you increasing those caused by 50% then thats still going to mean that the shippingresponsibility is no longer sustainable like so but if its happening to the industry as a whole and full to their customershistory suggests that its very difficult for them to do that so I wouldnt expect that to be a full paw through Bucks have to be at the back of the shipping companies enough money in this will not going to provide this service.we should make any more if they do shipping companies do I switch to 2 Diesel and its a in a quite a significant proportion at the market what impact would that have on the pricediesel the Marine industry uses around 3 million barrels a day of myself a fuel my guesstimate is that all of that about 2 million barrels-a-day switches to diesel the rest will be a combination of non-compliancescrubbers you can do some mixing with very low sulfur fuel to get compliant fuel so that too many miles a day be incremental diesel tomorrow and not to put that into perspective the global diesel Market at the momentis around a 28 million barrels a day market so too many and outfit is quite meaningful it represents around five years down the line growth coming with once now we have these things before cutIm so what you can do is you can look at for week of all of the So Cool Diesel track on the crack just means the margin to be made if you convert a barrel of oil into a power of product and if you look at the foodit suggests that theres going to be around a $5 per barrel uplift in the diesel cracks are roughly from around $20 a barrel to rent $25 a barrel tonight sweetie again point of significantis a flip side of this is well because you also go to high sulfur fuel crack as well and if you look at the food cuz it shows the the cost of a barrel of myself a fuel oil Falling by roundit was about what we will come to that in a minute but just again to give me a little bit of contacts around the impact on other Industries is it fair to say that given all the mentioned diesel cars at the top of thisis it fair to say that a time when demand is from them might be falling this is one way that diesel prices can be kept higher result in high diesel pricestheres a debate around for how long will they stay high because you know the old saying goes that you the cure for high prices is high prices and what tends to happen over time is that when pricing signals of thatparticipants respond to the price increases so its diesel price stays high for a long time you going to see more shippers in stool scrubbers youll see me in a some commercial and land transportation might shift to other formal invite my my questionschedule for example should result in high diesel costs has spots of the refineries who adaptto the different need so Im how are companies position for for this change is coming down his Demon World of Braceville margins In You by the crude you put it through whats essentially a very complexbolts and you end up with different types of products coming out of it could be gasoline Diesel high sulfur fuel asphalt whatever and so I kind of regard this new regulation is kind of loving a great big Brick In The Palms as it wereand there is a losses on the on their fight the refinery side of things so what you are very simple refina without much complexity in your Refinery you might produce quite a lot of ice off of fuel oil stock you come to thatit takes a long time to react because you have to spend money on capex you might have to install expensive capsule equipment and the moment you need companies dont want to do that since you were simple refined and out ofproduct stream you produce quality of myself a few loyal you going to be in net loser but then you got some complex refiners with all the bells and whistles in the refineries and they can basically take any time for crude and converted into any type of product and typically those werewineries in the US and so if youre a complex or fine on the Gulf Coast in the u.s. what you can actually do is you can buy the discounted myself a fuel oil substitute that for some Heavy Cruiser we gettingCanada put it through your complex Refinery and turn it into diesel that you can men get a much higher price for so for example the most expose our final in the US has a company called Valero consensus forecasts around 6 p.m.call for them this year I cant claim benefit for women twenty20 is around full billion so another 2/3I know it sounds like quite a big shift for for both of these industries they either the shipping and the oil companies supplying them but when you have any form of big change to a time a personunintended consequences to think what might be the unintended consequences of the social change so one unexpected consequence isthats it was hartsell funeral going to go its not just going to disappear so I can order the night too cheap to shape and what you will see happen is it will become cheap enough that we can compete in the pageant marketsand you could have a power generator complex instead of putting coal or natural gas into that sordid oil youll say this class of fuel is really cheap you know what Im going to run that instead and so for examin the Middle East in sound in particular I believe theyre making Investments so that they can reach OST that power-gen industry so it can burn myself a fuel oil that the net result is going to be that high sulfur missions are in the middle of the Pacific and the Atlanticget about Im not going to be over land and over populated areas then perhaps there would be some regulation in 10 to 15 years time we should start to look at that again but its the equivalent of whack a mole we mightabout to be regulated industry and so if your middle eastern government wants to burn particular type of fuel is no one there to tell him I cant do itI cant get you anything that you can think of where this might start to distort things and future from my perspective I think the impact is going to be out with the end consumer that we just going to seecrisis result for this some people have suggested that this could result in a global economic recession because you could you be my everything needs to get transported everything we consume gets transported sodiesel prices go from 20 to $25 a barrel and in terms of the crack thats how I diesel prices theres an argument that says also the refine is what they do is they lingo Max distillate which means Ill try and produce as much detail as they can to let me thinkgasoline so you could see the gasoline prices go up as well so you some people suggest that this could result in pyro prices High diesel prices High petrol prices and low and behold the Rind much lower than they were beforeHow likely is that in your estimation I think its I think its unlikely as a standalone event result in a global economic downturn put in an environment where the face tightening I would have got plentythe things crazy institution exactly this sort of well intentions environmental decision could result in the sense that hes skeptical if you dont mind me saying whatsuggest it was an alternative approach if if not directly this well President Trump for example has indicated just lost week that he would like a phased roll out of these regulations and I think thats onbecause as soon as you indicate they some kind of a phase rollouts than companies women Investments butt in if there was a phase roll out to about three or four years then you know youre not going to see Sadesignificant movies in diesel prices gasoline prices sobering to think positive surprises Jonathanmoney for the shipping sector itself I think I could be meeting some positive Im out come here so Festival this is a really good chance that these new regulations for some older less fuel-efficient ships to be scrapped gazellehow long are you coming to the Bible intensive or extensive Ill make so that none of the medium temp should lead to higher level of scrapping and Industry which should help with the supply and demand balance of available capacity should support Freight rates in the medium-termits also likely thats whats chips shipping companies tend to do in fuel prices rise if they would use the speed of that ships that makes them more fuel efficient it so we could slow steaming so this normally helps with fuel efficiencyincreases the the journey time that it takes the ships to go from portable hell keep high for longer right so the shipping sector although Im expectingis hifu costing in the negative impacts margins over the medium-term it should help support right right Source has been one of the problems faced evil for the two industries that we focused onbut for every consumer in the world with the risk of triggering a recession that said lets hope it doesnt thank you for

11,12,"hello and welcome to a new series from Fidelity International where we tap the brains of our analysts to learn about the industries and businesses you are investing in hows the weather todaythe weather now its like rain Im yoga is editor at Fidelity and Im at the smartbiz Expo in Hong Kong attack Trade Fair where you can see everything from the latest in automation to what the internet of things will touch next and of course theres the latestmobile technology almost in smartphones went mainstream some ten years ago theres been talk about what shape the next generation of personal technology will take thats known as the form-factor mostly what weve had along the way or incremental advancelist of the now ubiquitous Sleek rectangular design of that smart phone in your pocket or purse but recent advances in material technology could be about to change all that in fact our analysts think were about to witness the biggest stepchange in Mobile phones since the dawn of the iPhone about a decade ago the other obvious thing to any visitor to this trade show will notice is the abundance of Chinese technology companies Chinas Tech sector had earnedIm something of a reputation in the past decade as a builder of Technology mostly developed by others copycat rather than a leader but again thats also changing China is not positioned itself as a formidable player on the wallstage not just a mobile hardware and Communications but in a range of associated Technologies even in smartphones Chinese companies are now jostling to overtake firms like Apple and Samsung for Domination of the globeMarketplace showing New Generation in Mobile Communications and a new leader of the technology what could all this mean for consumers manufacturers app developers content providers and investors I asked our analystunderground in Asia listen on to find out more with me in the studio here in Hong Kong is Casey McClain and Equity analysts covering Tech carare semiconductors in a smartphone supply chain across Asia and Peter Carter and Equity analyst to also focuses on Tech hardware and Industrial Automation in Greater China welcome to both of you Casey lets start with the mobile phones themselvesand the step changer form factor shift that I mentioned in the intro whats happening here where was smartphones have been an unprecedented success in the decade or so since it released balloonsand sold and penetration rights gladly have risen quite sharply probably quicker than most people expected and that youve reached a point now where what was once a novel Innovation is now become pretty pedestrianimmature Market seems like increasing the memory size or adding some new features like face are they havent been enough to get people up there lounges said recently view Saints Samsung developed the first real form factor change in the lungsthe release of that foldable smartphone so fooling mobile phones arent entirely a new idea I mean weve had clam shells or flip phones that have been around for a long long time so tell me what exactly is new and different with theseif you cant is that smartphones become very powerful infect the author now is its powerful is at some of the MacBooks but the phone factory itself limits its usefulness this I need so much you can do with a small touch screenwhere is it its a foldable phone is considered the best of both worlds when its folded you have a normal smartphone that you can use in and has all the benefits of portability but when its unfolded like ayou going to file a large-screen about three-quarters the size of an iPad which means you can operate multiple apps at once much like a laptop or desktop USA pets use functionality like a penand if you would compare it with a portable keyboard that can replace many of the functions that were performed on the laptop and screen sizes that the rise of the phablets and I think Iveat the end of a 2017 the average screen size without fighting off inches of usability say your ability to use your friend in anyone hands and some people refund table Sequim will they sayis the if you can have a usability of a smooth line and then I will say the screen size of a large referring to the game or videos then you got the benefit of your tablet with functionality go smart phone cases have there been any like supposed to bea logical advances that have enabled us to get to the point of having folding phones or whats changed thats paved the way for this Infinity Flex display now they sayif they are OLED display technology with a variety of materials which means that the screen and the sign itself can fold many hundreds of thousands of times he is going to wonder is this not just kind of another gimmick or something that myreally, struggle to gain traction I mean Im thinking back to things like Google Glass the original Google Glass and how that never really kind of caught on DC this is is being a bit of a flash in the pan or is this really did the paradigm shift I think given its an is more of like a an evolution in existing technology that can I see bringing your tablet on your smartphone together to to Prosser to very successful in that I can write anything like Google Glass with some funny thingssolving something with 10 C in Fahrenheit in fact that isnt very user-friendly so I think it genuinely me so I can see Manny and its desirable you use genuine the same people with the biggest screens and we caughtwhats the maximum you can get with just one rigid screen so I think its genuine me to knees and that is unlikely to be just a flash-in-the-pan Casey Would you agree with that or yeah I think Google Glass was with solution WhitingProblem Child affordable smartphone that does make some genuine needs that youre having said that I didnt think change happens quickly in the IT industry and identify the four different if you look at laptops vs.cops it took two decades before laptops are the troop desktops and I think at a price point which is likely to be 1500 to $2,000 the Skylander surely will be pretty small Samsung is expecting about a million units to be sold in in 2019 and I think once they collect all the feedback on the hardware the user experience and how that pairs with the operating system that will cash for more of a full-scale launch in in20/20 & Beyond expect all of the major smartphone supplies to have at least one model in the market by the end of 2019 with the exception of Apple is probably going to beon that schedule Casey who are likely to be the winners from this shift then within the smartphone ecosystem now that youve reached a reasonably matures State the market will begin to consolidate you still have about a quarter of Cfind sold by the other place with those other than Apple Samsung and the full measure Chinese supplies Huawei xiaomi IPO in favor I expect their market share to shrink drasticallyand markets be Consolidated between the did the six big flies but I think the real impact of foldable phones is as a general rule big screens main speaks and says it is a direct correlation between thesize of the screen in the amount of data consumed during the first half of 2018 uses with a screen size greater than 5 and 1/2 in consumed 50% more. It and dies with smallest grain under four points10 inches and I think the the Advent of affordable smartphones will only accelerate these Trends is this more use of a video related applications things like YouTube Netflix even video calls like Scottit also extends the usability even further into gaming and thinking rating of a box becomes easier and better to use on a foldable phone and then that is even the potential substitutabilityjobs very bullish potentially for Telecom operators I would say yeah thats right I think its okay School benefit from the Grider. Of usage and theres also a distinct statistic the Depo total Cityis on my Sony perfect correlation between the price of a smartphone and the amount of daughter with the amount of services that use it consumes that will be a great benefit to Toca is also about the shift from 4G to 5G how oldimportant is Dad to enabling this kind of form factor shift with with smartphones or is it a separate the development I guess this is the big question about whether GCwhat do you use cases off of 5G one definite thing is the continued need for more days or specially in the oven tent areas so especially in transit Hub is already struggling with with a tube and Watsonfind exception various other things can semen usage of data will increase and intends of the beneficiaries from that side of things you need to see the rise of the Chinese equipment vendors like for wife and thousands that he especiallyincumbency Ericsson Nokia and Ill be quite interesting transfer Casey what do you make of this it turns it is this Chinas moment and in the The prominent role that kind of Chinese smartphoneplease but also further down the supply chain or going to play in this is this a moment where theyre going to kind of assume a greater leadership role Indian is generally people ever gottechnology companies related to All Things technology is being copycats but I think its not sign industry is it seemed genuine leadership position and a lot of that to do with that they much faster design so I canif you look at the locks of Apple or Samsung their Flagship 2 released annually where is the Chinese place have even six months is on Saccos and it means theyve been able to eat a ride with with new features and in many cases have been with us tomorrowwith the with some features such as a full-screen or bezel list displays pop up cameras Jewel or triple cameras as well when and under this by fingerprints so I think within within the landscape Kauai has really beenthe largest beneficiary and I think a lot part of that success is due to the in-house technology that developed the key part being the AP the application process at which is the brains of the smartphone and if you look at this mapMinistry there is only three brands with their own AP then Samsung apple and Twilight and these three companies have commanded a huge proportion of the industrys profits and I think thats any coincidencethats why I didnt quite a ways is a formidable competitor in the market and its viewed that way but pee is Apple and Samsung and I would not be surprised to see them it seemed the number one global market share at some point in the future.Adara the multi-brand strategy that they using in various markets story within the the Chinese ecosystem it was a company that was only phoned in in 2010it is already risen to be the fourth or fifth largest Supply globally and and I have a slightly differentiated strategy in the their tagline is they sell amazing products at fair prices so essentially you can buyand iPhone lock products at half the price at the Walmart of iPhones if you will or the Walmart have smartphones if you will and in some respects and their business model was not based on generating profits from the heartfrom the smartphones but they they plan is to gain profits from the internet services in ecosystem that they develop around their Hardware so many ways you can say that they had webbing the profits they generate from that issurvey customer acquisition cost to get use his own to their their internet ecosystem and so in terms of Internet economics is real benefit theyre the drawback with the limitation of the model is the potentially your usableof the internet services is limited to the owners of of of the hard way but we can expect them to gain greater market share but Ive seen in China and globally Peter what are you seeing I mean would you agree this isis this Chinas moment or is that kind of overstating the current situation by the number of Chinese companiessupply chain that starting to challenge historically areas y maybe Taiwanese or Japanese companies with leading penetrations the high and supplies so be that Nations you know you film lens to back you might be able to do the displaysIm challenging the Taiwanese Korean and Japanese display manufacturers say I think its been a gradual shift but quite constant in terms of trying to improve knitology Eric c one of the leading companiesnumber of ossicles has technology landscape developing new technology does theres a trade-off between Innovation and return on investmenthistorically the US companies have focused on Innovation disruptive innovation in particular and havent really taken a great view of the revenue or profit generating ability of a disruptive technologythe new tenant where is Chinas development have been firmly focused on Revenue the here in the now off of Revenue but I think their vision is slightly shifting to a longer-term vision and you can say this you need it is evidenced inroundabout in data spending now which is a long-term investment they have now become the second largest spender in our and a tall is overtaking the a year and just behind the US are tax account for about 20% of globaland its evidence itself in in output then they are men of research papers has also risen to 2nd globally again behind the US with a lot of that actually being focused on the computer sciences and endengineering say you can say that that is being translated into real world into into companys Charter is making pushing to to memory which is a key component in in bicycle it devicestonight Village leasing in The Foundry operations and making huge strides in AI which is important building the software with the hardware and Industry in particularmerchandise in Industry there on on level pegging with the US in and have potential to bathe are the global later in Time Peter what is it what does it mean for you if China is emerging as a global leader if you have a cross not just smartphones but Tech more broadly red is that whats Happening Hereyeah I guess so in terms of something that walking Equipment and supply chain youve already seen while A&Z tea in 3G and 4G Fremont Co. By the end of the 40 cycle and 5G they are spending a significant amount of money right now didnt release numbers that you can rock it bike it outI spend just as much as Nokia Ann Erickson combined us about seven billion dollars in 2017 so that they are very much of the Leading Edge of a fake 5p competitivewhats a custom bicycle frame then in theory they can take a significant amount monkashake lately if allowed to give the National Security concerns Supply chains thats probably more like lies ation coming in xI want so sad like if they can wear that Technologies available and Inez various companies that could benefit from them at the moment about technology thats made in Chinado you expect to see more of the same does fmu to rise and concerns especially from the US and Europe and some other countries I got something that my equipment slide because its so sensitive information secure information science it is not wax weather isgovernmental corporates so that very much concerned about potential spying excetra from these companies I think is that the especially given us find exception of people might be a little bit more concerned but while I already have significant motherin Europe they basically came along with Fortune game sniff to my Monkish a trailer cost of ring they tried as best they can to service wage concerns they dont see how you say my second respond but I think from a telecomas well these are very expensive things to build out telephones that works and if someone can offer you the same potentially leading equipment 20 30% discount to the offerings then its very compellingbring a dog show that was taken very seriously but it would definitely something it will be a come back to me too I think Casey how do you see things playing up I think the security concerns boys generally are increasing in the veracityin recent times and I expect them to raise anytime soon I would have liked it to your trainer in itself is huge potential markets and a lot of the newer Technologies Ive been developed at times with the benefitis a 1.3 billion population who are internet Savvy and they also have huge support from the government which is to the the Chagrin of of us and some of the western governments that they also havethe benefit of that if a massive Workforce of engineers in fact I have about five times the graduates that the US has every year I expect the development of the Chinese industry to continuelist of security fees or trade Wars and the government says it is as a real necessity for the economic development longer-term into that point I speak into a senior manager at one of the technology company yesterday and they mentionedand opinions by 2020 I breastfed of the global 5 years will be in China so even if they are restricted for some of these markets thats still a huge amount of money available for them and domestic Prosper without some of these marketschill at home if not abroad for the entire Chinese smartphone industry and the up-and-comers within it and that shiny rectangle in your pocket or your purse could look very different very soon thank you Casey and Peter from the Fidelity studios in Hong Kongthe listening and goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast isprovided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switch to send it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission or Fidelity the value of Investments can go down so you may get back less than you investposted legal niceties please see our website professionals.

12,13,"hello and welcome to the December edition of Rich pickings for Tennessees asset allocation podcast looking city of LondonBubbles and fairy lights out everywhere and in keeping with the spirit of the Season we have an overflowing stocking of a show for you today as risk it puts back on the table receptions of hoot off until 2021who is the catch what could be the last bull market for a while all wrapped up with a review of the yearwith me here in the studio all three of them all in fine festive phone and just hours1byone first Aniston its got a global economy in the Christmas spirit what do you most at this time of year, shows and this year in particular I cant wait. Room on the Broom which has a musical adaptation of the classic childrens story many times was my childhood memory of Christmas that startI think one of the strongest memories I have is when I was 7 or 8 years old I came across something tucked away in my cupboard and I thought it was telling me that was going to get a set of golf clubs for my Christmasjust like the most exciting thing and then I realize its a pattern for knitted Golf Club headcovers a lineup today is James Bateman Chief investment officerBassett James Id like to know what your favorite Christmas film is pleased with our Christmas Carol by myself Im every single Christmas Eve has been for many years in an hourcontend the most faithful of adaptations of Dickens Im there is despite the fact it is mostly starring puppets and who could improve on that if we make with the positioning that the group decided on thisIm in November of course we learned that you dont neutral across all asset classes what event 9th December so we probably had a bit too many watching it so we are now Im overweightshes overweight fixed-income underweight cash positioning to real themesnext one is this real prospect that there is this last leg of the bull market to come and missing out on that could be very painful in times of missing outside so I havent had a bit of a setback inequities the idea that were ramping up the position just slightly on endingevery chance that we would be favored which will come to Im sure Im seem sensible on the other hand we could be wrong and if were wrong with using cash given to the negative afterput on some cash and therefore it seems like the time to also increase our fixed-income exposure we are still under way to Europe real consentbrokensilenze at the market so focused on brexit its ignoring other risks and then we are overweight your pan out but you already but it was so overweight emerging markets and thats quite interesting cuz I wished upon the defensive Market underappreciated unlovedand you got measure Market with sheet on the valuation grounds at we like actually across the capital Spectrum so I can see them that we racing in 2019 still neutral UK youre not tempted by the fact that things areBargain Basement cheap know things were the price for a reason to a mind almost every dime she probably every hour every minute something happens that we expect and the only day that we can outsmart the market andRamen which has driven much more by politics and economics will fundamentals just seems naive an answer to take a position on the UK is to say we have more about brexit what might happen that we do that then then Ill pay his rent house in the market and I dont think anyone has that itchgoing to be okay if he ate a pill tell me this is Tammy with you with you about the UK four stars know Im one of those naive fools who who thinks I observe that titheduration of the UK is unusually depressed ownership of the UK simile unusually depressing situation I Prevail in terms of the makeup in the marketdoes a lot of exposure in the UK this actually nothing to do with the UK or nothing to do with the UK economy some people estimate as much as 80% of revenues in the ftse 100 arise outside the UK but thethe brexit discount process of UK sport in the midst of all this uncertainty is actually quite sensible you are planning headlong into the sunsetits a risk it back on the table jokes yes I think the risk is back on the table I think what weve seen is is volatility which as we expected to rise up some buying opportunities but equally Im at Im at which you you your puny being neutraljust doesnt feel active enough to take advantage of the opportunities that are appearing on whether or not you agree or either of the two different you guys dont say is its right to have an opinion a right to be doing something the macro perspective doesnt make senseJames and Bill risk back on when the headline setting Me Off full of warnings of impending recessions and if you read the same as you think you are right in your stashIm assessment is it something to justifiable to have those Warriors because we have the largest aquarium in the world that you asked set to slow as we enter 2918 and the facts of the fiscal stimulus facemontura tightening by its feather we have China the second-largest economy slowing with no signs of stabilization for now and no signs of big old style stimulus that could potentially engineer everybodysend Andrea a leading indicator which is global which looks at the number of global metrics also shows that Global growth is likely to continue slowing over the next two to three months so they sell Destiny 2it was suggested to me that we are in the light cycletaken in the US and there are certain assigns to in the cyclical an interest rate sensitive sectors and certainly already sometimes tends to science in the labor market that things are cooling down a little bit but this light cycle Dynamicscan play out for a while actually loss of policy support from central banks and sound fiscal policy in certain parts of the world as supporting girls alreadyLowes in the case of downtowns so actually I think right now. Heading into a recession of the next 12 months or even Beyond but of course its its its right to be worried and to continuously assess the risksHaitian something if you look at that the yield curve which is flat at the moment in fact there was some mix-up between the two in the 5-year bonds where its actually already invested in between twos and tens than fathe would be an indication that most people would say suggest is going to be a recession and actually sadturn off ads have the models I just had some others that are purely based on this indicator however theres also an argument at that it reflects more Market expectations rather than actual fundamental investors are expecting go to sleep at Central expectrecession but it doesnt mean that the recession is coming its it might come because of other reasons certainly use cuffs and a flat and some parts are invited but again its not assigned to our place that sell animal intercession this, not yet billed but what about your view on that so you fat times over the past year youve been rather more wary than most to MSU lookit Linda cases like that the old coach of you taking comfort from Annas Woods I am potato perspectiveI have as you rightly say Ill be more conscious this year and the the data has largely gone my way things have slowed and deteriorated and I think its interesting we not have a new caris telling us recessions coming out of a lamp to to the to the east angels and I know theyve already moved they are read the stanza bit in any directionprofile in the end of the signals are they giving the common trees its a company thing with the Yukon flats and withcall business surveys indicating the business Community is not quite as continents it was some of the messages from a mutual CEO sorry if we might see a father move in the direction wholesale business and widthMarcus having discounts the Lord by using prices done is that could be quite helpful in the in the short run policy changes untimely. Lighten the moodthe tone of a policy changes in the 870 feels a lot faster than it might actually be a recall for the market to behave as though every expectation to come.guidance for 2019 includes a lowering the dont then the market might interpret not as if a reduction in the interest rate Is Right ticketsthats you look at certain things like Im unemployment for example in in the states which time it seems to be picking up again actually been waiting for the last meeting of the fomchow do you say is it possible that a change of a computer is it possible that the FED might push off the hike that everyones thinking will come... Hes not on the cards I mean its obviously its possiblepossible is very unlikely I think the new ones have the wedding in the tone of everything they say supposed to be some very important and I think that fighting action itself in terms of a pool is a is a 2019 question. 2018 questionif no great shakes from the FED will the US then where else should we be looking at it for 4/5 a danger signs a picture of boring scienceyour area Italy is most definitely going to be in recession of the next two quarters and activity in Germany has been their habitats disrupted by some policy changes to know what the sack. And those disruptionsits seem to be long-lasting or and also some trade tensions and to all those issues in terms of external environment and how you have those affected the European day thats all I thinkto watch but I cant fit it in the E5 worried about recession this is why we should be looking now that you ask for next year a problem in the past is that any Cenawell this is just generally looking at the global imbalances and thinking where should we focus on suddenly this being a real real big Valley in house pricesin the most countries most about markets outside of the US and tell when we look at valuations theyre really off the charts housing market is is always at the center its its the transmission mechanism between the real economyFinancial market and thats why we should be looking at it the interesting Transit over the past year that were seeing is that some of the duration in house prices in this countries that didnt see the correction in the clubNational crisis and continue to see the booms in the house going prices on the back of Saint Michael prayerchild policy specifically targeting to achieve the schooling in the housing market that with think we are waiting to see thats what I didnt know thenyou know the policy makers but I think if we see another big eye like a big external shock hitting this country is the smallest in the housing market will certainly propaganda schalke and exacerbate the downturneyes wide open as you stride around putting the rest back on how do you do it what do they eat most of the areas that Im that youre looking at right now as you seek to step back into the marketsalready about the UK where I bought some exposure of bought back some short positions and I had in the in the 5252 the the mood domestically orientated and cheapest part of the UK stock market Ive added someHoosier in emerging markets and the story there revolves around a potential for the tune of us money supposed to change and to be reflected in a week or dollarthis year the American markets have faced the most youve had wins the transmission of title policy from the fat around the world his his head hard and thats been accompanied by the phone if both those hadwinIm being Toby I think Ill be very welcome in a minute in the mail to Market so about it to me. I also had some job positions in u.s. technology that I added before I couldat the end of summer Ive brought back some of that but I continue to be witty of the semiconductor sector buy mini for restful at site of the Earthparticular to the industry itself have been well reflected in idiots like Korea but much less well reflected in the semiconductor stocks in the United States let me come to you about to change.about the overall allocations and you just make that but where else should people be looking at the moment you think in terms of attractive places to invest perspective I think the the thing that we always took my styletell she want some and I she continued to think that the appeal of value vs growth play enormous any country is is it is prudent whatever your view on the direction of the Mark at thinking outside of expertise Im in fixed-income definitely emerging-market that Stefani agehigh heels with in the theater and pretty definitely not investment-grade I still like your sweater evaluation editing this information because Im worried about inflation and can do that hedging clean between make money Im weak on underestimate goldtime to cycle at why look at Golden think maybe its just not prudent out of a bullfighter this is not one of them this is a time I go to the proof of your writing and gold use its its not whatbrilliantly well but it says its no problem and I have to go in Brandon for you I had no idea the environment could be really quitegold if you see real interest rates for see the dollar fall if a chance to see if inflation surprised to the upside I think all of those things would suit go very nicely we going to haveReflections on the Avas bean and then some projections we did it come safe and Ill start with you if I Met You in 2018 for me was that we saw I thinkthe real first taste at all from what tight liquidity a global liquidity might mean for markets it was across them but notstem not just at the measure Market. Its sold out we had the crisis intervention team never had the crisis in turkey and it touched the corporate debt Market recently this Autumn something that hassetting up in vulnerable so far and I think these are all the symptoms of the same problem and of course we discussed all this through the year but I really think this was the first year when we sawexample of what this part of that policy number the station hold in store for us 2018chance of my own investment stance the group has been the I had the shape of it right we started 2018 the consensus was incredibly foolish you were supposed to do at 3% yearand it was a year if we arrived with C polishing normalization in Europe pulsing normalization in Japan even and talking about risks on the downside toplay I think being a bit more cautious in a bit more circumspect when the people were so optimistic in December and January has been quite tense of theI had a seam in the early part of the Year revolved around energy energy was extremely good in the first half of 2018 and the way I implemented that view in my portfolio buying usequities principle was definitely a mistake on my part I want betteryou got that wrong I think in the US investors wearing chanted with technology and if I have to have a lot of exposure to technologyjust was the case for the first three cuantos Monaco to comfort someone is going to come from Big Santos and so energy was excluded from peoples my list because it was something that we thought was even better where did you go toEurope squishy Mansion Marquez was exceptionally good very frustrating markets in the USHouston Xanax when you reflect on on 2018 what was going to happen when it did so we knew we were going to see your face guitaristand a cutie cutie Cutie we knew we were going to see increased volatility cuz rose tattoos Route 60 love youre actually knew the things which would at some point stop that endless up with women to every one of them knew that and despitewhat are those things with major issues the paint and I think that was that was a very interesting very interesting yet I didnt want to tell me interesting is I did anyone knows whats going to happen with that those what those were neverevents 2019 trysting how the market wrap something is not expecting with when if its expecting some of the negative it starts panicking thoughts for the coming yearwhat makes the unexpected surprises be the unknown unknowns has brexit decide to OmniFocuspolicy opposite the general expectation is central banks will continue at hiking on normalizing policy very slowly maybe the federal post cycle but always and no one expects.might be back to puree or someone can enter policy mattress if we do had them to a shop has slowed down or even especially if were wrong so I think if theyve got any ammunition left to spendwell Jackie says they have a lot of tools so we believe him so that that is something thats an expected to end and another one on the fiscal policy France incidentwho decides to unleash a big physical stimulus thats going to be a great news for Europe by surprise maybe aloneSeminole Lanes to what you just heard from I think things are just enough in China that there will be more policy from China and drug is talking about dinosaurs right I think ideatightening in Europe we might be surprised in 2019politicians be sensible Insurance to to do a bit more for school to to do a bit more money to put ever in the mixes and that the labor market and we weektranslation and I think I think that would be quite a big short for market and the implications would be profound using government bonds to hedge risk not workingexposure to long duration high growth stocks in the environment I just described not working a 60/40 passive portfolio that dominated by longer generation high-growth US dollar and indexedthe bones that.

13,14,"Im Rick and this podcast is for investment professionals onlyplay with thinking about the world in 2029 how will we be investing in a decade whats the global market look like for examplea worldwide recession of resets the economic and corporate cost what about the wealth management itself will changing tastes and Technology affect the way we invest change the way we Define investingsince social norms in gender equality affects our approaches joining me in the CJ to guide us through these questions and lead us to what I hope will be the sunny Uplands of 2029it management of Asian person end of senior credit analyst are you a glass half-fullor a glass-half-empty person so if were talking about the real economy going to be calling me Im definitely in the in the optimistic Camp theres quite a big conversation I better the movement that says to be kind of braids with extended Echocycle where where bright light cycle is accounted attend I hear a lot and that there is a kind of an expectation that a recession is inevitable and the debate is really around how deep will A procession Bay where is II I look at itprices within the global economy in and could see that she asked me to look at 2019 and actually for the 5-10 years beyond that we may I should be in an extended. Of growth full for the real economyits alright then when will let me come to you you are some credit do you share this optimistic view of the economy is we as we go forward a look at the US are pretty healthyquite so sure about Europe I think one may be out of consensus few I have is that we could see some strong growth in the real economy but have the markets not perform quite as well over the next 10 yearsbut you wasnt even looking at food as we approach the 2020s the thing we need to be prepared for is what what does the world look like in a in a low rate environment if we if we need to think about that for the longer-term into rates have curly risen this year although back off a littleback from that but I think given the state of growth and given the outlook for inflation were probably going to be prepared for a lower rate environment for some. Of time and put long enough to take it off so its hard to say for that long of a. ButI do think we we might be in this sort of blissful stay where we see a modest amount of growth in the in the overall economy and a reasonably low rate environment that thatll keep things moving along and it is somewhere Direction I would definitely challenged that viewI think that there is a need of The discus idea that we are going to sustain a kind of a low rate environment is very much the kind of the environment that weve been over the last 10 years its its really the direction weve been in ready in the last 30 years we are classic League Cityprepared for whats a change in the environment kind of looks like and I think one of the things that could take us in that direction is if for example we saw that a tightening of monetary policy actually caused the economy to exceland the question is how could that happen that seems a brace of the counter intuitive perspective but effectively I think that what happened as we continue the reduced the price of money is it actually below city of money has collapsed so the multiplebut the people think that you would thinking Cub ice of increasing the source document has not been that so perversely you got to a point where you increase taxes so much that I should people does a low propensity to so to pay taxes do you have this phone with inverse correlation cell typemonetary policy that has a positive knock on the flight to the profitability of Banks Banks prepared to lending and the multiplier effect kind of kicks in and and in those circumstances you end up with inflationthat youre not really prepared for but Festival you you are nodding along to this picture you what your mother says she is such a band as we look forward to the next 10 in that big picture sends Im does that make sense you would agree with Terraces on a a sort of one or two-year of you with the tightening of monetary policy I am fully expecting as are many peopleincrease in volatility weve already seen that in the last few months I think were in a world where that will continue the other side to that argument is demographics with an aging population the need for for refinancing ofcentral bank issue ends its going to continue to keep pressure on deficits is going to be this counterbalancing a fact were central banks and others are going to have to manage down the rates in order to just keep to keep the economy going in a way to maintaina balance between the cost of debt and they need to refinance that that because the money that is going into the system pumped in their bicepssummer arguing that we need more mr. violence disruption of the status quo rather than the slow mechanism of demographics that you would but something much more violent parasitic to change thelandscape I think that the disruptive factor that comes into play is it for a very long. Of time he could be the next 3 or 5 years I think that the central banks will position themselves very much behind the curve but they will come a pointbut if they feel that they not able to control the economy you end up with a kind of us some step changes with nothing but we should also emphasized is that the types of things were talking about it you know if they do come to pass will actually benefitloss of people in the real economy because for example you got returns to labor the like of which you havent had for the loss of 10 of 10 or 15 years old so that the equation between the returns to labor versus the returns to Capital will be Carnivaland so how will that make him is in half an hour will be the driver for that if you if you if you start to see wages go up the massive accumulation of wealth with the ashes anus at that starts to reverse Im happywell its if its so lets lets lets talk about your starting point to the moments you looking at most economies most large blocks and butter instead of Japan would receive even here in the UK or the us or Europe are you starting point alreadyemployment is is quite large so theres not a lot of slacking in it in the in the system so any environment which describes the idea of the kind of Dammam surprises on the outside of the net kind of 3 to 3 to 5 years but then then the valvethe moves is going to be real wages that the people side of it to you you would see a compression in margins of wages it going up these companies what would the impact be there because we had companiesteam sustained for long time theyve been able to to carry on because theres not so much money keeping them getting high with that change I think we will see wage inflation because of the on the lower slack as well as just pulledcold pressure in several different countries in the US for example a few years ago on the election of trump also the rise of Bernie Sanders in my mind is very much so that you know in line with a populist fervor the populist movementthose who perhaps lost out over the last 20 to 30 years really coming back to bear on the political landscape how would that again if you take this on a 10how do you sync up my shift shapes things I miss most impossible question cuz its so proud and so long and its view but the tectonic plates are definitely yes absolutely but you know itcan also happen through gradual or peaceful means so as Costco up and labor cost to form a major part of the cost structure of most companies that says Costco up and theres more return to theoccurs as opposed to the shareholders Des Peres has pointed out that means that profit margins are going to go down and I guess back to my original point I think that could also mean pressure on insecuritiesyour concern is whether these companies that that you cover it going to be able to honor the today taking on you get more worried as you look at the landscape is it is it begins to change anything that reducescash flow is an issue for credits and so from my point of view obviously would its a threat but at the same time I think we should also recognize that the way that access value has been allocated over the30 years on the way more and more has gone to shareholders thats a trend that could perhaps be reversed without necessarily really damaging the underlying corporate picking up one on one month, it says it does a tangent and touch her tongue in what Paris was mentioning is that theres this underlying premise that growth is good and Ive been reading a little bit about recently does it necessarily always good andif you think about the environment impact where Coal Fired power plants are do you know increasing the temperature in the worldfeel we are the movie consume more power plants are you putting into the environment so what if we end up in a warwhere is conceptual where we decided that we need to reduce the amount of output and that that is considered good for the videos for the greater good of humanity I know its a bit its a bit high in the sky but it is a concept out there and you can see himnext 10 years with pollution on the rise at this is this is a concept that will become a reality in many countries have Pepsi told us a different way of measuring Grace that has different ways of valuing things all together whether its acidwhether its the way thats an economy is some is developing yes we will have a balance or looking at things in the round so whilst Ineed a disagreed with with Monty that growth is getting high I think we will be all I need to see you know the growth in India in the economy I think that will be a much greater attenuation to the broader stakeholderput in with a not so they grow so I think were were moving from is a world where we had a very singular concept of what good growth was an interesting point where has interestingif we if we using up in 10 years time that the way you value assets might not be based on professor Wolff whatever they did to eat it till I get its okay to be the same calculateyes I think I look at my Siri on this is that you know how much more it will be it will be based around the future operations so if you look at the you know that the fundamental acceleration that was seeing in the crate the destructive process around so the corpora so you knowBang from 40-50 years about sort of 25-30 years ago to Interpol cost to be 14 years and probably love it by the time we get to 2029 then actually Ill be much more attenuation to terminal valuewill be intensive short-term profits I cant women just wanted to add to this idea that maybe our parameters and are changing maybe going forward its not going to be all about earnings per share or return on Equity we are lookingother ways to Value companies and attach you no long-term value to them but I think that definition some framers are getting redefined on all different fronts as well for example were rethinking GDP and questioning whether that isright way to measure growth and sustainability in an economy that brings us to our next topic actually which is a pirate Steve at the disruption within Asset Managementitself. Mostly let me let me come to you to you expect that to continue when will the industry be in in 2029 data is more more plentiful andthe need to figure out what to do with that data how we incorporated in in our analysis is only at the velocity of that is increasing the way clients look at look at potential investor versus the way you known asset manager will lookversus an Isotoner I think theres a lot of different topics to discuss their having one of the core ones that I think is near and dear to to the fixed-income world is how can we continue to embed a quantitativeI meant the fundamental research more and more and doing that topics like behavioral Finance rrr have entered into them into the scope of thinking in the last number of years and were doing a lot of that ourselves but how do we continue to embed.how do we utilize that data how do we process it more efficiently clearly will always need to meet with management teams and two. You know try to get a sense of corporate governance that clearly brings in an ESG theme to ithow do we pick up pick up our data that enables us to to look at that even work more in a more efficient way investment at every level and if its a call to arms race what is an endmean right so Im not talkin about macro investing here we are looking for changes in minutia about treasury rates and talking about how we can use Big Data how we can use artificial intelligence to try better decision-making I think with the early stageisnt that right now it we were already in Bedding nudges into our our investment platform where perhaps were enabling analyst and portfolio managers to look at a wider range of investments just by utilizing the data betterI think the more we sort of them bed that has a process the more well keep on itll be a circular a circular benefit to the whole process and you mentioned fees how will they change and how that presented to you two kinds yeah I knew you would bring that upmore efficient and more transparent transparency I think clients are demanding it. We will have to expose our views a little bit more efficiently and and a little bit more quicklyI think the fee structures are are going to be compressed in a way that we will have to just make sure that our analysts teams in our portfolio management teams are just utilizing the data is the best I can to take him back to idea of transparency how important do you think that will be tothe investors of of 10 years from now I think it will be particularly important to the up-and-coming millennial generation by 2029 is still wont be no form a majority of assets under managementto the two studies itll be something like 16% but in terms of whats important to them transparency ranks very highly indeed in fact I think their cultural impact is probwe going to be bigger than the actual acid because they are leading on culture and technology is changing so quickly changing the way that we relate to each other even for the older people likeand we are being led by the younger people singing voices of people with differentIm Fusion you give him lots of fun ideas by the only economic so I have quite a different view on thinking about this one of the medium-term prospects for the industry andbig part of that is influenced by you know just remembering that there were very few things in the world off of Marcus and Investments of the kind of structure that she sings do work in cycles that could be a very real Prospectthat we look at the industry in 10 years time and that she what weve done is ReDiscover the value of active investment and ReDiscover the body of fundamental analysis now why do I say that Williamyou would say that wouldnt you absolutely I do feel that in the last 10 years and particularly in the last five years weve seen a boom inthe types of strategies that really think know about a shed or or security is being a part ownership of a business but really is being a kind of a price but correlates with other priceso thinking about things like Factor investing small pizza or outcome orientating investing than not really interested in the show as a unit of all be on the line company that theyre actually looking at so the shares inColeman behavioral kind of characteristics so in the sense that that that thats what it one step abstracted from reality and therefore if you are as I was saying earlier in an environment where some of those fundamentals are going to change more profoundlyfor the next 10 years then you can live in that world of extra abstraction in the most innovation in finance actually ends up kind of turning in on itself after. Of times Im always worried about trying to like structural like innovatively in adisruption I dont think applies to all to our industry is a kind of you know as a phrase I think the clients needs and what their interestand what they want to achieve is going to require more active management in more Innovation you know if I may use that word and in terms of how we provide that service and we think about Baby Boomers and you know so many of them retiring andliving longer needing to save more some of them needing to work longer you know they have very specific needs that they need to have filled and then when I think about like the two probably you know largest up-and-coming groups with Millennials Gen Xthen also women and how you know the differences and how these groups want to invest their money its going to take more active management you taking us to another area that Id like to coverwhich is diversity and inclusion because I know that that something that you were a champion of that the concept of inclusion is not new but the me-too movement seems to have given it very much more how do you think that is going tobe reflected in Asset Management me-too movement is going to have a very lasting impact on business and general because what its done is sort of pulled back the curtain on power imbalances in the workplaceand I see this thats what it being very much you know attached to the entire womens movement that kind of erupted in 2017 with the womens marches cetera so the way I would talk about this is not to just CokeSaint gender diversity but to think about the quality of the management team and whether they are incorporating cognitive diversity and its not so much that I go in and take a look at the border take a look at the management team and really analyzeset for you no diversity however you can see that when a company is really able to navigate risks well its because its got the right combination of people making the decisions theres been a lot of research done about the benefits of cognitivediversity how they can increase its profit margins return on Equity Im generally speaking you have lower leverage the organization the environment is getting moreFlex successfactors we talked about all getting less homogeneous and hens I think you need in any industry much more of a kind of a multidisciplinary mindset and much more kind of cognitive diversity noticesalso I think that theres accountability for recognition that given the you need to ensure that youre attending any advantages you can with the lack of diversity means that youre not even during the Douglas TV ring customers so you know you how many feetI kind of responsibility as well so I think this is going from something which is a bit like we had we talked about with with other systane ability fight to see the things that have been talks about us as kind of nice to have things I think that becoming absolutefundamental thats how it feels in the moment housing guidelines for would a decade of the conversation that we going to be having about this then I have it back into something that we all talked about which is transparencystress that management is to to continue to attract the best talent that we can whether that be approaching gender diversity racial diversity educational diversity and transparency is only going to help theirthanks and did I have to start in schools that has to start fairly early on so if we if we want to attract more females more more people from different backgrounds and it took to this industry then we will have to start start to it embraceit within the educational system but I think the more we can open that up and show it asset management is and then and then I think the more will be able to attract the right Talent win-win if you think about it youll companies and the discussions that youre having at scytheas well as as as within what do you expect to be joking about it in 10 years time it will just be a guest on and we will be post genderTrace is 10 years long enough to achieve I think thats a little optimistic but looking further out the goal is to not to need to focus so much on this because it it just is a gifeparis what do you think in 10 years time was it a conversations so I think of our people might look to doing their entire career in Moanastraight out of there may be a greater propensity for people to do a. Of time in finance a. Of time in software. Of time in media and these are the portfolio careers which we come currently associate with so theres much more seniorpeople in touch with a late stage of that career they might start much earlier and thats maybe something is an organization that will have to equip ourselves full sounds like a very different roles in some ways but some comes to you so hateful eight the best of boost Oasis intoParis thank you very much indeed also to Marty and win-win and thank you for listening goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be reliedmy private investors this podcast is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switch to send it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of the value of Investments can die down at the weathermake it back less than you invest all the important legal notices please see our website professionals.

14,15,"this podcast is for investment professionals onlyhello and welcome to the First Fidelity real estate podcast my name is Adrian Benedict investment director and over the next 20 minutes or so well be talking through the most pressing issues facing the UK real estate markets whats going onHigh Street and what it means in particular for all landlords press worth remembering all landlords ask its a pension schemes are investing in this asset class in particular another thing well be talking about is thisshould and its implications in real estate its rather the two words destruction of real estate find a home together in the podcast Ill be talkin to Mark Young Mark is the vice chairman of stifel Investment BankAllison Pugh how is the UK fund manager here at Fidelity and came Pulitzer his own head of research I started by asking him where the UK property Market finds itself wellhope to see people are looking at the difficult political situation in the high levels of uncertainty but I think the interesting thing is that if you look at the real estate fundamentals the market doesnt look breaking the name and say we havent seen signalincreases in unemployment and therefore we havent seen significant decreases and demand for spice in fact if you look up the global take up numbers for the UK I take up spending about the 10-year average base in the office on the districts in industrial sectoryeah and that means that in those sectors rents have been stable in some cases about she been rising sun from an investor perspective we still see plenty of dry powder talk to European real estate more broadly but London has still beenscratching its fair share of that capital and investors continue to look at London from a wide range of location so we seen big deals done by German Spaniards money from South Korea run from Hong Kong during thesay the fundamentals look like a Rosy picture given what we might be saying on the newspapers on the TV screens is that what youll see a tional side sings definitely fieldsimply comfortable yes tenants particularly for large shiny Office Buildings or maybe being a bit more cautious about making decisions to take more space but on the industrial side discontinued Du Monde take hop competitiontenants for good quality units of course retail as a whole nother story which is very tough at the moment alone holds some research recently suggesting quite significant monk Downs are we staying innot yet would what are you saying as it were on the high street from that picked up the games and very big numbers its a mixed picture out that but generally quite negative in particular for shopping centersincentives of finding that its very difficult to plug the holes when tenants to part and its a cumulative effect so you lose some of your key full tenants and you remained MN Im also disappear Im selling shopping centers of probably of the seadeceptive retail Warehouse shopping centers and High Street the toughest at the moment for landlords if we look at High Street retail were also seeing difficulties guy weve got a few small and they can units and all portfoliojust being realistic about the relaxing rent and I able to get some Demond across the piece fold-out space I think people arent being realistic about rents and not being realistic about pricing theyre going to end up at the end of the year Im looking forsend a 2019 with some really big valuation. Come retail Warehouse I would say is mixed depending on your location so you need to really be focused on the sentence with the transit riding bus up about 10affordability and stop depending upon the shopping centers or perhaps cheaper places where they operate such as retail warehouses operate a little bit more intense lets imagine youve gotcapital T to put two what gave the next 6 to 12 months the headlines that went negative Aarons Thinking with messed about catching a folding knife if you are. Where would you put your money into the retail space a vBos to FLL I would be focusing on the retail warehouse at to put looking for Hops at those locations where the rents are in the region of 20-25 pounds of raw been significantly high from thatI think thats still a foldable spice retailers and it works very well for them to take you on click and collect some bog giving your perspective to the market houses for retail fitting playing outsidespace will the stock market go up some pretty clear indication as to what he thinks about the retail sector the moment if you look at a different property company is a trading in the moment in terms of valuation by which the main bank smoke is iscancel premium to the three companies who are trading on the biggest discounts to a Navy enlisted set go to moment retail property landlord San Ysidro shopping center landlordCaptain regional trade settlement 40% discount Hamilton trades on a bigger discount night and into is trading on a 67% discount to current net asset value of course at least one to twoMotorola note the shaft price is correct or whether they necessitate value against reset share price is being compared it is wrong meme often it would seem to me the stock market is saying very Lively to the valuation profession to that datedont believe the valuation throughout that for shopping centers of retail allocation and sit when youre building out quite sizeable positions is it as simply no longera coupon to the darkest my commercial real estate allocational doesnt like it to me I think it was the two off to this really its have you been clever enough not to incentives to day enoughenjoyed that the benefits of that poultry allocation on your performance but then going forward its going to get even worse for those who who doing and really anyone who can write size have full tailgate Im to knowsend WeChat is going to be in fall back to shape as the next few years when it comes to bank smoking performance under this morning I was going to say at New River has numbers and the other is just a little bit just being really very very little valuationfind food for Land of the Lost couple of years says theres a lot of pain to be had from owners of reach out who had do not have really real estate valuations and I think thats a lost people important to the storythe best quality shopping malls that offer the the experience that everyones been talking about that how that physical retail has to offer experience again to hold up their values but I think the reality is that its going to be very difficult for basslike Haitians to see that rent stabilized because so many retailers are seeing that profits squeezed in that for rationalizing that portfolios so I need the very best store best-performing stores which means that the rentto be affordable again picking up the same the Allison has been focusing on will be the ones that continue to have occupation so I think thats there is some real paints come by face of the Prime and the small cat as well as the second round of the mallso perhaps that was fast food in that favor and lets see its played out of next years DC that begin the opportunities with some of this retail space as redundant MOG I think in the short time its a huge mistake to a careerproperty and say can we can we buy this on our own a good value basis in the retail within the next many many years will become good value is when the land values have fallen so far that you can buy it those buildingswe develop them for residential or some other usage looking at these things and thinking that you can inject a valley retail proposition is more of a a deck deck cha Shuffle strategy the mom what she will yieldIm could pretend to invest as a little bit because I think that the will be retail but well still be an attractive place to shop by date that we going to go to 100% online shoppingpeople to enjoy the retail experience physically right sort of experience its not going to be a me to town with the same old boring faces where I she takes you longer to find something in the shelter than you can on your new smartphone so I didnt will be likeas ever we always do this in the real estate market it will be over done so there will come a point where it becomes very attractive to get back in putting it back to you that I was to be down there in the real estate marketshow me next month supposed to be not even next year Allison I do agree that we will continue to do lots of helping um on the High Street hotels in San Jose that have no data and internet retail penetration the UKs blow twenties andghost say to get hike that sees your spouse on but we need to think about the value of retail property in that context at the Emagine vacancy and voiding of Supply we have today and then it will be growing a mind to avoid and vacancySupply I need to know there will be plenty of retailers who wish you a phrase in a given send to they will be able to drive incredibly hard bargain so the rents Ill get into rectal down and down and down because my boss is it going to take them that and it on that basisvalues of shopping centers today are still far far too high I guess thats where Im coming from the window to millimoles I think at the end were going to come to another thing that should have a favorite of everyone at the moment is that Jen you eat we

planning.support these change the view some some I think some Lake Worth or shes already starting to see the need but I think thats thats enough lots of requirement for Michael Thor cheese to really understand that those retail values offpulling on that I cant rely on retail Wrightsville Valdez to to support that covers and that to create a sustainable Community Day two against have to be part of this changeperhaps that might actually be some places that perhaps less Grim than the retail High Street Im looking Im getting slightly quizzical faces I have to say so see I was only saying by you just now in the UKpocket you top storm Logistics industrial Im seeing rental growth and Im seeing a valuation increases and thats his in the board of whether its Warehouse lights IndustrialLogistics and Musubi is my career never moved in in the industrial sector that we had to. Im back in 2008 2009 rents went down and since then this bephenomenal Grace in space rental values and also a valuation of the industrial properties in the industrial sector but were thats letters to today is that its become perfectly normal to pay your billseven in the three slow fools for industrial space dont expect rental growth and here is where the market will make the same mistake cuz quotient makes which is treating old properties equally and ready that mental growth is only going to comehave the rights expected for the Bari Weiss properties so I think I picking your way through the mall still good Bonnie to be to behind that and Im particularly fond of London and Southeast Industrialsimilar thing to what youre saying in the listed Market Logistics come onto better pricing suddenly that companies we talked to involved in logistics continue to be very enthusiastic about them but okay what Allison is saying that theres a pricewe may be reaching Peak Peak pricing so what one needs to be careful that they think clearly the ever-shrinking supply off of London oven steaks facelanguages it is wise tracking other areas supposed to be raised to think about the first one I might say which might surprise her every listen to this Market youd want to be out of the city of a small kit fitwe ourselves right into space at the moment we want some any reason to 50,000 square feet and its beginning to look like it it might be able to the landlord smoke it there is no Fox News space out that because its a futile as but if you want to be in Attalla there are not many options so thats thats an interesting Market took two to think about Housewives ready to be mentioned Healthcare is a sector that we continue to like and somatic we typically its people have liked and focused on sexrecent years which cannot be disrupted are not disrupted by the internet Healthcare assets would be one nice residential I love you places to live is another retail is clearly not confuse me.yes I think I think that theyre all skanks be some big themes that change the way that property is used to use Dave the next 10 to 15 years I think thatthe industrial rev the fourth Industrial Revolution I think its the the interesting while on how we use offices and what sort of requirements that will be for office space and looks been told by about the wework phenomenon and how thats revolutionisingIm not entirely convinced that it but its we work so its important in this story but the ways we work on the way particular the millennial generation wants what may mean the offices needs to be used in a different way and Technology needs to be brought intothe way that we managed office space and occupy office space in a in a in a small Sway and will change perhaps the fundamentals of what a good good office looks like the other things that I think a big things for theXbox 10 years old the demographic thing which gun goes back to thoughts about health care. Housing and how thats going to change in particular has been a lot of talk about how Millennials dont wantwho sings anymore side parts of shift away from iron ship of housing to rental house rental housing and how that might change what our housing stock looks like. Its a purpose rentalsI think that they sit theres going to be big changes that perhaps influence photos look like in 10 years time and I will be a move away from Justice straight 3 classic retail office Industrials to take in some of these changes in the way that people liveand why the people working the way we work now rather than we live that thank you for that phonejust bringing you on that big steamatic changes are likely to be driving so how we use our current space weather is where we live where we work insightful but from youperspective is an investor hes trying to deliver a real estate explosion consequently real estate retired thats quite profound changes because youve ever had to deal with is investing in retail office in Indiain a previous life I love experiencing a student holds and other type of social housing I think it is important to remember that all job is providing space to peoplewant to pay a rental it will have without spaces and suddenly on the in times of the the fourth Industrial Revolution we have seen across all whole portfolio or intense pussyfood proposals for feet out as theyve changed to save mature to save developed by ways of working in their offices and it typically would you send me my space that they want us bringing in more hot desking much more working from home I mean evenI was hes doing that now Fritz office move so I think we seen the changes happening those space requirements reducing and I think it makes a little sense to think about different sectors where you have.long-term income mean your best ultimate match for something that says pension fund in terms of investment should probably be something thats more in the residential sector. Disruption tothat was pretty much everything the belly mentioned brexit is brexit even a concern but Ill get fast on this one because its obviously a topic why I ranby saying no one knows exactly what it is yet and Im not sure whether we will next year on either I actually think that the structural changes so of the move to online retailing thechanging the ways why can the change in the ways we living are more important changes over the next 3 to 5 years and tons of the performance impact and above and beyond that certainly wont be sore whenwhats the brexit vote and post that the currency is a key driver of underlined performance of Assets in the UK with very open to foreign investment and displays going to be turned on and off depending onposition the currency yeah I agree about us and I think the currency question is an important one and its not simply about brexit I think as weve seen quantitative-easing on winding andET now happening in the US that fly for a chance and interest rates is going to stop meaning of currencies move around a lot more in that they could have a big influence on investment into the UK it into your page the next two to three yearswhich is which brexit just makes more difficult to judge because it creates left additional uncertainty to but I think that those face Transit interest rates are going to have a big influence on what happens and things are going to be again moreFortune turn the political issues were facing with brexit I do say much brexit related uncertainty out there at the moment that I have no doubt thats dont markets will catch them woods and outputs a lotcoming months on the back of what appear to be set in case I havent even factored in the Dell recover quickly as well this is your monkey gets used to and you know which can each go and get your Crystalwhat do you see as being the most significant change to investor allocations to UK real estate market Kim I think it is going to be thisstudy changing allocations away from the traditional sectors I think we will yet people will focus on income but theyll look at where that where else they can get income other than the commercial sector I agree with killing peopleincreasing that other sector is already around about 10% of the average portfolio things like student holes hotels KY homes in the line I think that will continue to increase in part driven by the fenceselfindale office index Lincoln long leases need to have that that faces pressed very hard against the window reality and understand retail values will decline sustainfor a long time and that hes going to massively reduce retail allocations one way or tother on that note Kim Allison talk thank you very muchthis podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entities 282 sent it must not be reproduced or Sac Unitedthe Posse without prior to Mission of fidelity the value of Investments can go down thats why I was up so you may get back less than you invest all the important legal notices please see our website professionals.

Play doesStates the weakness but the impact could be here for some time and its theres other reasons to be negative on both Global trays over the next 2 to 6 months at but also just glow whats a PCwhy would suggest certain summary you focus based on the Fly Basin was the date of this coming in to make out that picture and paste it at the beginning of 2019 yes glue activity will continue to soften forand some place is already quite a week place at the end of 2018 in German industrial beta at the end5 year sleep very grisly in in Europe that were start see attentive Bossman Outdoors so if that continues I would really help coming from Asia certainly the weekendseen earlier in the year was as a result of Asia and Emerging Markets slowing in particular but in fact the route to Brazilians might be a results of the Arizona actually holding up domestically a little bit fasterright back in the cji Mana it sounds and looks pretty Dreadful that youll still confident that when not heading into a recession at least not yet sure you look at theres a lottalk right now about to almost an imminent us recession and I think the probability that its is very low yes were seeing a slow down from a very high and sustainable rights of close to somewhere perhaps around1 to 1.82% growth in the US but I think the consumer has the support from touching labor markets and supposed to feelwages the savings rate is high and theres definitely room for adjustment on the consumer side. Consumption makes up a 70%off the gross domestic product in the US so its very important if you remember back in 2015 manufacturing was essentially in recession but they Quantum still deliver positive rate of growthconsumer everyone always under arrestpresidents of the US economy and The Residency rescue team has no more about the market we know that he may have taken his mind of hurt for a while you might have folks started flexing on other things but the reality is Trump doesnt want a protracted by mouthhe wants a bull market at some point something more positive hes going to come out to the White House that supports markets probably and thats what youre betting its too pretty major things that wasnt the US consumer and and Trump in terms ofdirections if youre not long at the moment Im having to actually see if a lot of things to eat once like a wolf is by the tax cops physical changesyeah theres two things of Masterpiece to me that if he could announce them for something happening to you is out that would push markets are markets for your mock be positive and they can end up with us before they actually come through so who knows but that is a lot of options on the table for him yes in Frenchtext message very positive view of the US which brings me to Nick youre not positive and negative you say to my mind is still so this is a relativeplay for us and I just find markets outside of the US for more attractive than the US itself obviously cheaper now on 15cDean X compared to the end of last year last year but if I look at other areas such as I mentioned the UK but Emerging Markets but I know you can wait the ratings have found more attractiveand I also think that and if you have a weakening dollar thats going to be supportive forever is like Emerging Markets as well its like the the US Cellulars and listen to this shouldnt take it atRussian Saiga fence is just a remote right to knowthats not what they would admit but I think none of us would want to be in jogging shoes right now and to have my answer to your question about your session.thats what I worry I will ever worry about the recession in the Eureka area and the risks of that are much much much higher than in the US now its true that domestic demand is still strong andand mentioned it briefly but I think the deterioration on the external side is still quite significant driven by the China cycle and that is clearly showing an APA in the date a particular in Germanysome of that is driven by one of factors such as regulation in the water sector but most of it I think it is due to the continuous iteration in the external cycle that will ultimately it starts peelingto the domestic data manufacturing that again its not just because of the changes to regularand it is the demand from China which is really key where does this leave the ECB as you say not many options of course they can go back to the old tools or the test tubes kiwi rehabs the Florentso fab and interest rates is not properly been tested as we can go lower belly below by -40 basis point but I do think at some point they should at least thats what I think I should do rather than what they mightis to put more pressure on the governments that have created the environment in which the government didnt really have to worry about supporting The Economist weve done a pit with with withpolicy its over to you with physical stimulus time that you need to take the pain for this fiscal and together with structural policy tobetta growth outcomes and I think now its really down to governments to do that now deposit that will not be smooth for sure but I think Ill definitely its going to be much more effective move from the citya complex picture around the world not sure which way things are going for sure but I spoke to your economyPhoenix Wright today with a wide range of fund managers in Asian Emerging Markets Analyze That performance infused and special some interesting Trends off the people that you think to continue becauseI am going to look so miserable and yet thats not what you think picking up in Asia and Emerging Markets Equity is the very margin the mood is to increase risk and not in portfolioscorrection in Chinese equities in 2018 and a couple of factors the strong Dollar on one side and then trade Wars and also most importantly a domestic slowdown in Chinaan older Asian is sling to China EMS are ready to take on risk again that they sing the outside are so in order to make money in the marketinvestors need to distinguish understand what factor in prices so thats very important if market prices already discounting I slow down thats so that would be already bakedto the prices so chances are that that we have seen the worst in inequity prices and chances are that going forward were going to see its abbreviation and an optic the nurse is going to buy you things hes just at the margin when its at the marginthe direction of travel is being to increase risk so I couple of value investors in Asia they were really overweight China for free samples by another 10% or so theyve moved from 105 and they have reduce cash from 7/8 down to two actually one value investor in Asia is actually reopen his own strategy to exit investors soC12 to deploy more Capital because there is an abundance of us theyre not only the cash in the family came down by the rosary open the file I mean thats quite a strong signal opportunities at thisI get it now in China and young Restless arm has been talking about downgrades grades they see them coming but if they are in the middle between 3 and 4 per cent best rated baked into the pieI think they are more in the Campbell by the time I get slow down no more no more than that. A mild slow down more than that is so pretty and Carries him in the gymkisses kisses how they use cash when Im at Seneca back to find rest in cash because I think that paid to be invested note to note to keep money on the sidelines Im but nonetheless Im some do very that cash allocation jollof I need some reason good indicator of offshoreGametime lightning Market moves when cashmeres up and down and you are seeing this troubling me to sort of says of of cash being deployed into new ideas I know Nick talked about Emerging Markets if they were caught it was Emerging Markets is an area we fully is a Teamster that have a complete canthow much is the UFC Im at the mobile dish side of ovary MCM calibration grams and I think the actor managers are affecting that very effectively which is that there are a lot of stops at a very attractively priced and pumas price for at 4economic recession that isnt particularly to come so I can use in a many people Central case so yes there is material stock level outside but she just went live in the cycle at the moment a manager of property managersI was saying is that this actually with your energies you can move away from the storeno slip of investing we sold last year 6th grade style and managers are now moving more towards looking at Value style of how do stocks it tickles financials because thats where they think the next brotherChevron friendship performance will come with the Fang stocks the text they took a tumble at the end of the Year Ronnie that kicked in but at some pointwell take a closer look at the u.s. states and what what happens then this feeling that the growth was strong and that this can last fortime and then at the end of last year we started seeing the first signs of the South so down and two in particular the latest PMI this is the measure of business confidence in the US for DecemberI showed it quite a significant role that spooked markets to some extent so absolutely Marcus already focusing on the data on on the side of course its always a nun on the shifter tomorrow.I was recently but I do think that there is too much fear priced in fear about recession and then thats why I think perhaps the marketstake a bit of time but but the markets will realize that I actually the economy is still in the trailer to the stronger hooting at least for this very very late stage of the cycle earnings season coming out as wellits going to be very interesting to talk tell the top down dates of the week at before companies are saying play management we can forget about the results for 2018 but it was the manager talked about in terms of the outlook on lifeso I can have a significant bearing on Market direction for the next few weeks with side like a hot potatoFestival youll have cakes please I like the Japanese tea and I think the fundamental supportive valuation is also supportive but most importantly it has the safe-haven characteristics that you would just be goodGavin in any of the photos right now I like that perhaps versus the US Dollar on my hood potato is US treasuries perhaps Elizabethspecial birthday again given my Avion the US and on the FED I think he is way too low for weather going to meet us and for where the fat might be in a few months time so I will.I would choose that as a mouth date when I see income funds will give themhangout yielding north of 7%.

I think the other the other angle of it is and if I can be a bit cynical about about how fixed-income analyst or cynical we tend to be a littleskeptical about the world instead I think I think youll get that balance of an equity view in a fixed-income view as it relates to development to the overall environment sex in it on its own known fact its one which has suffered one of themschools in sentiments are some of the big companies in the US and tells us hear what she thinks is going on two months to the key drivers of cost price inflation of beinglabor costs and freight costs and that probably the two biggest post items for retailers in general some companies will be more effective than others because of the way that they ship items around the u.s.inflation pressures that are from labor and freight costs Harriet if I she goes home later in the interview to say that is the cost of Labor wages within Freight does the biggest rather than fuel pressuremargins evident elsewhere they are I mean I think that we are definitely seeing a pickup in wage inflation repressions around the world I normally you would hope that these can be passed onto the comesand margins would be protected I think we all sing some signs that a margins are starting from a very high starting point and then secondly in an environment where consumers weakening its its harder to punchlets cost to the final consumer that was one of the strongest responses coming through the the survey run Martins wasnt it yes it was and interesting me I think also the consumer discretionary side was one of those sectors which is suffering the biggestat reversal in sentiment and I think you know they were a number of factors that work there and thats the cost pressures as Harry described a we could consume up ticket in ChinaIm really the sort of head winds that affect the phases in terms of the move from High Street to online reading if anything accelerating anniversary is more and more goods are delivered that puts up with pressure on on on Frasierfree calls and most inhabited concern is that squeeze on margins from it from a credit perspective one of the things that showed up in the survey was that our analysts generically see balance sheets deteriorating particularly in the US that is a factChurchill to think about it we do every day as far as that goes your balance sheets are still relatively shrimp if you could get leverage through through the cycles over the last 10 years it has increased in its back towere back towards where we were approaching 10 years ago pre pre Global financial crisis however if interest rates are still low by historical standards in and yes funding costs are starting to rise which is another thing that came out of the surveybut theyre starting to rise from very very low levels and so it doesnt concern on the credit side as far as what this wage inflation will will do to a real company balance sheets so you to my funny cuz being low will that beno rights environment right at the moment because hes a very benign information picture infection May well start to pick up when you start to see it in in in wage increases I mean there are some classic late cycle signalme through the survey and Im sure well talk lot of a lot about that one of the teams that had picked up on about increasing costs within the consumer sector is a pervasive theme throughout the whole survey although with wages Rising presumably consumer sentiment which would rise which endsValance attached to it to a degree you would hope it would balance it at 2 degree but thats certainly not. The picture emerging from a consumer analyst I just said that maybe in part because theyve been somewhat beaten down by some of the othershe said in the sector one of the one of the points to really be be concerned about is if wages are rising you would want to look to see what the ability of companies is pi * 1 +they also suggested that there is some pricing power in different sectors but broadly speaking concern that that companies may not be able to test how long the price sale have to absorb it back into these motionsyou place a nudist to where we are in the economic cycle of course the recession it does seem to be a big theme for 2019 so many peoples lips and lost the animedirectly which stage of the economic cycle that companies are in much more support for the idea that expansion is extremely mature at many more onlost your calling out a slow down and fight roughly one-third of the analyst in the survey reported slow down this year of us is just over 10% in the prior year but still interesting New Britain the survey very little supportthe idea that were in recession if you read headlines this negativity around themselves into it to a degree that the analyst and not saying that theyre not seeing at the accident at 4, so thats not that thats not the nine that pick you up from talking to companies know you might hug use that companies are almost a lost to live in some cases but thats just not the message we getting I mean when I look at our numbers the a cricket numbers from all of the financial models in the systemit is really consistent with a message that yes growth is slowing but with nausea and recession are clearly theres some factors that we need to think more closely about in terms of fiscal stimulus in terms ofis the part of interest rates going to be quite as aggressive as some of the sort of people calling for recession of talked about with sudden getting a mold of each turn in from the Fed so far and end in 2019the right point which is yes growth is slowing but we also game were coming off of him very very strong. Of growth in 2018 so its so gross and and I think thats whats driving a lot of analysts responses is guess things are slowing downbut its not disastrous and at this point when they look 12 minutes out theyre still saying High single-digit earnings growth and Aggregate and so that that to me is is it still okay well lets send it take anothermoments waste one if I honestly so she covers financials 4X again other late cycle signals one of the 2018 is significant inbox of alternative sources of capital which has been inhibitor to US bank loan growth alternative sources of capital might be hedge funds private Equity Funds insurance companies or evenloan funds by mutual fund companies tends to enter the market sort of leader in a cycle you tend to find that that is typically yield-seeking ordisk see seeking types of funds this is classic Elite cycle signals wherethanks who who are under significant regulatory scrutiny from the global financial crisis are still under this pressure and so few no companies need to raise funds and and theres demand and said that theyre looking at other sources of capital I think one ofplaces that we really see in the credit markets is leveraged loans and has been phenomenal growth in leverage whens some of this is on the demand side people are sort of investors are positioning for a rising rates and leveraged loans Tempeputting rate instruments inside theres some natural hedging thats involved in that the risk is that leverage ones are supposed to be the safer part of the balance sheet and unfortunately because its late cycle companies have a lot of pricing powerand theres very few investor protection that we typically like to see in a more senior part of the Capitol Theatre cuddling so particularly nonexistent until I think were only picks up or not it is something to really watch out forI mean its interesting from an equity point of view probably Equity investors reassured that the banks are not chasing growth at the expense of margin because clearly what we seeing sense of global financial crisis of the banks significantly repairing themSheetz substantially improving at Capital ratios and really putting themselves in a position where for the first time since the crisis they can start really thinking about returning excess Capital to shareholders about boosting dividend growthmy sense is that bank investors with much rather see that Capital come back to them then chasing growth that may or may not be there if attractive rates of return on the on that Capital but they finally in a position though Im to tacklelost crisis but we can move maybe token another description position for the for the next Crisis whatever it might be a better position if another crisis comes because that balance sheets are in much better State than they were lostand run it would help with funding costs going up Marcy all the expectations that default rates with done with go up this year well. Thats it its picking up on quite a few theme Sierra one of the Dynamics in the market is we have a fairlyflat yield curve and so what companies have been able to do is if they if they would have taken advantage of a lower interest rates at the shorter-term part of the capital structure they would have had more short-term financing I thought your car was meant to take a push out these maturitiesso I think another one of the reasons that the analysts dont dont see an imminent recession is that the funding what was quite a few years out and so if you look at the statistics its not until 21 2021-2022we really look at briefing at Sam needs for companies so no pressure really until then no big pressure and thats right well that sounds cool rather encouraging what temperature are the positive things if you find in the survey Michael I think thatsfrom an equity investors point of view I think its important to note that we are perhaps less positive on dividend growth how to cook but still positive so dividend growth is in Frank the strongest indicator sendthen survey I mean then I dig down into analyst models and forecasts yes weve got dividend growth slowing in 2019 but we still looking for 5 to send blue blee thats a real rate of growth vs inflation and it isadd a poll. Less than the 8% we were seeing in 2018 and I think a similar picture emerges on things like qapital spending is capex is weaker but suddenly that has to be seen in the context of really very strong survive accountspending in 2018 and in fact first predicted in the 2017 so far as tech stocks and he point sites abouteffects of fiscal stimulus in the states of fading meaning sleigh with business in his sector send a Mennonite and spending has changed a fair bit from last year but I think that is something we should observe relative terms rather than absolute with the reality aroundit says that last year United States which is one of the largest Spenders and Ill be spending had a significant tax change which allow a lot of companies to move some of their tax savings into a into it projects and that led to a significantacceleration and Heidi Spencer went up to 8 9% if you will and since that time for that as a comparison point 20-19 was always expected to slow down a cement giving us an example are some of the front loadingwill happen is results of President Trumps policies last year and it does that explain the folding capex expectations we seeing this year so we will see if you look at the us there were two major themes going on last yearyou had some fiscal stimulus hitting the market and you had it that the change in tax code into both of those were significant drivers of earnings growth in 2018 I think one of the things that came out of the survey is an expectation that the Trump policies wont beas a positive across two companies that that handles cover this year but that shouldnt be that much of a surprise given that in 2018 was such a big year and the political situation is a little bit less certain than she are given that saw the Democrats are taking over the house soyeah Im not at all surprised to see that analysts are a little bit more cautious on the ability for the US to manage some of some of the fiscal policies this year but negative from that I still just positiveTrump within the us but externally its its really concerned as a lot of discussion about deregulationworking in the financial sector I never talk about some pump priming through fiscal stimulus so Katie sunshine has come off that and at the same time the whole narrative around trade being very sicknegative tickets I think it was to take a prevalent in the news of the time of of the survey said thats Katie one of the factors we need to see how that plays out king and country 2019Richie from asianae Casey McClain as an analyst based in Holcombe he covers the Asian Regional Tech Hardware in semiconductor companies and hes telling us to be exchanged observed in China Revenue last year is veganracing on Sunday price from consumers and corporates to driver this is been the Triad was within the corporate sector and there has been a big guy push to delay automation of factories andI see expansions in the back of them on that have the risk that they may need to relocate their capacity to Southeast Asia to avoid the haunted some investment in case I need to moveThai tea also describes Taiwanese companies consider removing home from the May 9th and American companies what youve already moved operations to Southeast Asia Vietnam Malaysia and Thailand Tiffany hit that look for China which is why we seen the biggest foolit suddenly hit the outlook for China sentiment with particular week in China trade with what was part of the narrative but I also think just checking with performance to kick in the 4th quarterwhat was reading some of the weakest weve seen in China for a long time so Im Auto Sales were down over the course of the year and in China but actually the fourth quarter was down double-digit every send me a picture of emoji on smartphone salesso will we be seeing the first or the negative numbers being printed in in in China starting in the duration of the survey and I think one of the Intriguing things was that yes sentiment in China was negative but I actually the closer you getChina and tons of analyst on the ground the more negative it was a reversal of the above the prior-year survey were actually our analysts outside China with much more concerned and what about the picture in China becausethis being some stimulus from a monetary policy attempts to eat to boost the economy the res physical stimulus as well but its the picture that the government has recognizedtheres too much debt in the system its something weve been paying attention to for quite some time and were starting to see some defaults in China and you may be surprised to hear this from a fixed-income person but this is actually a positive thingthat were starting to see a little bit of what I would called managed to faults evasive return to reality it sits for companies that perhapsreceived funding that didnt have the most robust business plan some of those companies are now being allowed to fail if you will and were left with a healthy economy if thats the end and if its managed well by by the government toCarly is is quite involved in things then then I think it would leave us in a much healthier stayed in and that is our general View lets just try and come up with a few summaries from from this years and a surveywhats the main message that you left with Michael at the end of August Im very much like to the message of slow down Rising recession and a Slowdown that we have to see in the context of a very highstarting point in 2018 Vue number of questions on ESG and sustainability and its clearly last year the same waya dramatic increase in the focus on companies that we cover on ESG we didnt see that dramatic increase this year but we will we see a continual increase in things in andhang up on the China thing that showing some continued increase in the number of companies in China that are actually thinking about ESG if theres something thats a little bit surprising that came out of the survey its its that time. In China even the numberthings that are focused on ESG continues to increase which isnt something youd expect and in peoples preconceptions perhaps its right that I should choose to act like to think that we have a little bit of something to do with that because youand I was asking lots of questions to management teams and we hope that thats planting a seat globally for them to start thinking about sustainable issues and Michael give you enough to make you think of anything surprising that that popped a servicecrazy first went through the day check when we when we we got it back from the other list too surprising things that I would highlight one is perhaps we are saying its a slow down an end there is a certain amount ofhuman Doom that pops could it be worse would be my question then the second thing is that people are just becoming you know for want of a better face board with a help little Glenn BarmanI definitely feel that some of the set of geopolitical risks.

17,18,"hello and welcome to a new series from Fidelity International where we tap the brains of our analysts to learn about the industries and businesses you are investing in Im Neal Goff age editor at fidelitywelcome to sing Im at the Singapore Zoo where every day thousands of visitors get up-close-and-personal with orangutans the worlds largest arboreal mammals these Majestic ape spend mosttheir lives in the Treetops of the jungles of Sumatra and Borneo its where they eat sleep and raise their young but it might not be long before zoos are the only places left to see these creatures theyre critically endangered because millionpictures of their habitats have been illegally logged or cleared to make way for palm oil plantations and the palm oil producers are under increasing pressure from consumers ngos and investors to lessen their interminal impact from the jungles of Southeast Asia we moved to the steel mills of northern China where the government is closing the least profitable in the most polluting plants in part to reduce the thick stalks smog they can hang over the homes of hundreds ofmeans of people this is strong arm top-down industrial policy but it is snowing just Financial losses and improved air quality so what did these two stories of environment-related pressure mean for the Indususing question with short-term pain brought on by external pressures lead to long-term gain for the companies and investors involved and what might that mean for other sectors facing similar challenges I spoke to Fidelitys analyst on the grillI need to find out joining me here today infidelity is Singapore offices in the heart of the Marina Bay Financial District are for is Schultz and equity in thean analyst who focuses on metals and Mining across Asia and then Lindley our research associate who covers equities including palm oil producers among other things for us to Mainland welcome to both sexeshas been taking a rather top-down approach to cleaning up pollution at its steel knows what have they been doing so their original reason they had to eliminate his capacity was that you had a steel industry in a coal industry that had a trillion dollars of liabilities thatbeing effectively serviced so the government decided we need to do something to improve the profitability these companies so that they can pay down a lot of the stuff that they had and then when they decided to do this they were quite clever actually in saying that they would do this in a way they would havesecondary benefit of really improving atmospheric pollution so they went after the steel mills that where the dirtiest that were the most dangerous and they they just basically shut down this capacities you know were talking several hundred million tons of capacity that was either illegal orjust unneeded really give us a sense of how big the steel industry is in China and the amount of capacity theyve taken out what is that in the bigger picture they eliminated probably 120 million tons of illegal steel capacityIm being recorded in statistics anywhere and probably somewhere around 200 million tons of legal capacity so youre talking about to North Americas worth of Steel consumption of capacity that were wiped off the face of the Earth has theyve done is weve seen Market improvements in herequality in China particularly in the Northeast where the prography is particularly challenging and pollution tends to get trapped in the winter easily a move of pretty Epic Proportions in terms of the scale and scope of things just as the same as you sound like the growth of the steel3 inch I was probably something weve never seen you know in the history of the world weve never seen a d capacity push as big as this anywhere else in the world either under pressure from external party so we safe to reduce there in factenvironment that pressure though is come from something quite different than what we see in China whats the situation there Nestle that have been coming on the presidentteasing me because of the way they have been sourcing Pomeroy as well as concerns on the way palm oil has been produced in planted by plantations actually result in deforestation because Forest have to be clear in order for planting to takeplace and actually is one of the key producing crop for Indonesia apart from Timber and pop for example and then leads to a loss of biodiversity because its not one that when palm oil plantations replace for itthis results in the loss of Flora and Fauna as a result of replacing Forest the pressurebasically from Byers and Minnie from Byers at the end of the supply chain have a very visible impact on the environment is in termsair quality specifically youve been in northern China on a bad air day or whats on their whiteboard airpocalypse can you paint the picture for a little bit yeah I tend to go to the less touristy parts of China as neometal in mining analyst Im usually going to steel meltaluminum smelters in coal mining towns and you know I can think when I was in Jung Joe maybe half a year ago a year ago it was in one of their worst air quality days and this is one of the worst cities in China for air quality and as soon as we got off the train and leftHaitian you everyones eyes were burning in the back of your throat you have this kind of like gritty feel and it smells a bit of sulfur rotten eggs and its pretty pretty intense what when you keep in mind that this is a city like 9 10 million people were not talking about me wandering throughthe actual aluminum smelter this is just walking through the city by the train station on the flipside you know you go to the cities and it looks a lot like Shanghai used to look to me and no 2004-2005 or whatever and there has been is on the flip sidecredible Improvement in the quality of peoples lives actually found that same shirt but I went to Jim Joe I was in a hotel and I can talk Sean and there was a guy who he had kind of a bit odd Chinese and I thought the first maybe he was making fun of my Chinese since my pronunciation isnt perfect either but I realize itactually almost death he was wearing this very high tech you know hearing aid and I was thinking man when I came to China 17 years ago a guy like this wouldnt have been engaged in the economy at all he wouldnt be able to be a productive person because no one would be able to afford this when youre traveling through these places you see theside of this industrialization the others development has really been incredibly beneficial for these guys but on the flipside the environment and you know it has to be addressed Midland with the the air pollutionmaybe thats not the main issue when it comes to palm oil production but it has been this was everybody here in Singapore right now if only for the think about it in 2013 and315 South forest fire can a broke out in Indonesia and then resulted in air pollution and Bun is the result of dry weathercan actually just even result in primary Forest being burned as well so its kind of hard to track but if you look at Satellite mapping the only thing that we can kind of attribute it to is the fact that thats been burning Happening Hereas a result slash-and-burn and then we attribute the flame to them and burn so that you can plant palm trees basically I think on the clear day we have PSI is about 3040 + PS I swear actually more than 300 during those two years do I need to be in 2059 thing around the month of October or so and thats when its considered really has it as level schools I usually close when PSIbetween 200 to 300 and in Indonesia that were reports that PSI be on 1000 Escalade 3rd when Singapore government race this to Indonesia became a political issue and so thenname the pressure on Indonesias governments to make sure that they they do something about the air pollution I recall walking on the street and math were actually all sold out everywhere and I use my hair as a filled up with regard to air pollutionthats one kind of symptom of expanding palm oil production but the bigger one is you said earlier is kind of the loss of biodiversity and deforestation what are the companies themselves doing about this or how are they responding to thisthese pressure be at from consumers or intermediary buyers or even from Lionel neighborly governments like a like Singapore is coming out in making sure, Plantation kind of sustainably run you actually go back to a point in time in 2004 when the Roundtable for sustainable palm oil was formed from several stakeholders are we have WWF you need liver and Anna Malaysia palm oilossetian and several other stakeholders coming together to come up with standards which dating will be suitable and applicable to the palm oil industry in terms of environmental and Social and Health local communities should be better managedpress the key challenges relating to the palm oil industry and as a result company started applying descendants in the planting and it was only in 2011 when the Indonesian government started coming up with a moralvolume to prevent new conversion to palm oil plantations from primary forested areas and as a result of the pressures coming out from the haze issues in 2013 and 2015 the Jokowi government which came in in 20skin came up with a new regulation to extend the moratorium so this has actually resulted in companies stopping new plantings especially from year 2010 on wet so we now see a much reducedEsau even 0 piece of new plantings at least from the company site which can be more visibly regulated across the industry I think if you want to go back inIm planting for Pomeroy actually came in between 2005 and 2009 for Indonesia we have about at least 20 to 30% growth in new plantings every year and sincemoratorium came out in 2011 we are now seeing negative or zero new plantings that are coming out from companies what we are seeing right now is more replanting because Papa has a 25-year cycle so for those that reach maturityhe will then have to replant so new plantings of very limited from 2010 on what and as a result of this if you think about the impact on pamalee Supply we will start seeing the whole supply of palm oil going down more dramaticallyfrom 2019 onward structural undersupply basically that weve kind of against the man of lets say 45% per year for about 60 million tons ofmy consumption put you moving elegantly to China and the steel production similar situation you use seen a lot of Supply coming offline how does that affect the near to mid-term outlook for profitability of thisyeah I should drive distinction that its not supply going offline its capacity going offline tonight right so if you look at the steel production in 2018 it was actually very strongly up year-on-year but because theyre competing against less capacityis fewer people able to produce the profitability has improved sharply you think of like a normal through cycle steel spread and by spreading the price of steel minus the three main material and puts you know Iron Orecall and scrap the normal spread would be somewhere in between $200 220 $230 somewhere there and during 2017 late 2017/2018 the spread was closer to $300 scene of the high to hundred dollars soyou know thats not just a 50% Improvement in profitability cuz you have a lot of fixed costs depending on the company you could have seen them much bigger increase in profitability than that and was also seen a big Improvement and how these companies are has there been able to pay downthere that are there software costs to complying with this siren from a from a company standpoint there they challenged with you no spending more investing more to meet the tighter environmental admission conditions were regulationsyeah I think this is about as close as you get to everyone kind of just winning right that the external costs are yes deal is going to be slightly more expensive a ton but thats really passed on to the eventual consumers of Steel so you know if you look atPennysaver building maybe no single digit percentage of it is still costing and that went up by a few percentage talking a few percentage on a few percentage so you dont really see that cost impact anywhere on a social level but the benefit is huge in thatreally reduce the financial sector risk like before he still knows all going bankrupt could have really bankrupt to the Chinese banking system and before you know when we had all this dirty capacity it was it was clearly negatively impacting Peoples Health so I think this hasreally you know what an economic decision with incredibly positive environmental externalities and theres another component to talk about this systemic risk of underperforming companies theres also a potentially unemployment problem that could be created therethe interesting point of but if you think about the Chinese labor force this is no longer growing this is been shrinking every year for the last couple years so the need to really create jobs in China is much lower than it would have been even five years ago just based on the demographicshape of you know whatever you want to call the the age profile of China we no longer really need to create as many jobs you yes there is a need to create higher-quality jobs yes you see organization where you want to give jobs to People Mover Countryside with the level of pressure that the government is undermuch lower than it was before the other kind of issues I was thinking of is going to China was ruffling feathers among keep trading partners with vast amounts of Steel exports the years and now if youre reducing capacity takingCassidy offline or theyd then disincentivize to export into your trade relationship skip a little bit better yeah your intuition is correct you seen a drop in exports in fact of Steel from China as yo both because theyveand a reduction in the amount of fast they have it also because there is strong demand for the steel so in 2018 there was a drop in exports and beyond that it kind of doesnt really matter if youre exporting it and youre importing steel cuz this spread that everyones enjoyingits kind of common to everyone across the planet so China is consuming about half the steel on the planet China is producing about half the steel on the planet if Chinese profitability improved American profitability improved to some degree Japanese profitability improved to some degreeso this Improvement and utilization that China has enjoyed his also been enjoyed by everyone else around the world as well with palm oil producers in the situation is it a comfortable situation where this coming kind of shortage of capacitywill increase the profitability it would impact on palm oil prices will start coming in 2019-2020 when we start seeing the supply shortage coming through as a result of new plantings godown to 0 - negative levels from 2010 on what by right now what we are seeing is a situation of oversupply in the edible always market and one of the key drivers for palm oil prices is actually that of soybean oil fightbecause thats a key substitute for palm oil so thats one of the key elements that will kind of affect the Dynamics of how palm oil prices should treat apart from the whole Supply shortage issue as wellseeing in China if you look at the winter of 2017 to start of 2018 beyond the capacity reduction programs they also have production restriction programs capacity reduction programs are really just about getting rid of excessI see them for the profitability the winter restrictions are really focus just on environmentally troubled areas and then saying produce less deal during this time or emit less pollution during this time as theyve kind of shifted to but in the winter of 2017 / 18 we saw25% year-on-year Improvement of chi air quality kpis as measured by the Chinese Ministry of environment ecology their target was 15% so they they overshot this part of this was due to you know weather and atmospheric conditions being predicta favorable but either way that the government really made it a market Improvement youre on here and I and what they were looking to do so you know the environmental groups we talked to they were incredibly happy like they were impressed with the progress I think its exceeded everyones expectations where does that leavewhats next in China are we going to continue to see these 25% reductions youre on your influence animations or is that a temporary blip I think that the 25% reduction we probably wont be able to match that rate of decline but I think the decline in bluewill continue theres been a change of strategy where is before the central government gave down top-down orders to you know eliminate x amount of capacity in this region or no restrict production x amount in that region now theyre sayingwere more concerned with the outcome were less concerned with how you achieve at 2 if you want to invest in scrubbers or if you want to invest in some other technology to reduce your emissions you know more power to you and were going to allow the local government to figure out how to reach their targets rather than telling themreach your emissions targets via capacity Productions or production reductions and then I think once we get a little bit further along I think the next battle is really are going to be for water and then the final battle is is for ground or soil pollution and water isnot as much of an issue for metal in mining it is an issue but for aluminum red mug creation which is a byproduct of making alumina is a huge issue and so I expect this will be a big topic that will be talking about future years Midland or do you think things go from hereif youre forecast holdup will see a fall-off incapacity a shortfall basically wouldnt that then encourage another flurry of people running out and in converting Forest land into palm oil production again on a toothI feel bases but have been consistently renewed because of external pressures coming through from environmental watch groups are the governments to make sure that the pollution standards are contained in Indonesia and Malaysiasongs of the flurry of new plantings coming through I think that that wont happen this cycle I guess the next battle for the Pomona Industries more of ensuring that small holders comply what we are seeing in the past few years has been the pressure onbut companies are larger companies to make sure that they comply with the sustainability standards but it has been hard to ensure that small holders live up to the same level standards and I think we need to address that because they fumble 40% of total productionin order for people to really change the impression that we have on palm oil as a whole how to Giant Industries have been engaging with signalexternal pressures over their environmental impact and what their response is mean for both their long-term sustainability and profitability Id like to thank my two gas to Midland Lee and for his shoulder and from Fidelity Singapore office thank youfor listening and

You watching us behavior in terms of do we see the increases which not quite substantial passing through twoand consumers and if we do do we see a surplice Go full out that means the Trump caucus you this pussy for that no mess with the Chinese will be watching as well I sent you the question of can just Trump have to fold at some point we keep the Sabbath goingis waiting for the Diplomatic game to start playing out in the economic leading indicator the flight that are dates arrangedplay sets to form a picture of the states of the global economy and where its heading for reading at this months fly after it returned a much more optimistic pessimistic reading that it has for a whileand welcome to you Im his to grab the Fidelity leading in the case of the fly thats moved into a positive reading for the first time since February 2017 is it time tocrack open the Champagne Police a policy Richards it is positive acceleration for the first time since since way back then but its still points to growth below trends at the top-left quadrant so yesacceleration but still relatively some Jews and certainly below Shrine of trophic levels so the question really is part of the fly progress from here so were going to probably get a Boston in growth some time in Q3 giving it to the the flight attendants have3 month flag but thats not really enough to get excited about so looking at the the underlying indicator is the positivity Diamond Thief Grace negative and Westernwhen he wants to wake up to that every morning so that finally turned the corner where is that Improvement coming from the individual sacs are is the improvements reasonably broad base so business surveys grinding that bit higher industrial ordershe start singing set to reflect that to to the consumer in labor indicators of perk top and most notably global trade which has had a horrible end to his is reach quite decisivebut I think was perhaps most interesting is looking at some of the individual indications that are really turned these are the ones that really look quite catastrophic going into the stars of this artistreally next levels and steaks and this might just be a the normalization after you know I dont use fluke wheat Im weak patch that to me suggests that there might not be that much more Improvement in the next cupMinnesota dead cats bones sing a bluefin is going to go back to where it was the year Amber the same time it might not begive me names Casper stumbles on what should we expect then for the rest of this year based on what youre seeing in the in the fly flags yeswere only just getting into the positive acceleration now is that we see something of a possum in activity early in the third quarter of this year and then thinking a bit beyond that I saved it might be a couple of months of stumbling aroundas we try and make that that decisive at floor beyond that I think towards the end of the year so its at the policy measures we have seen coming in the fats the US Federal Reserve turning and submerged Market Bank startingChina. Yes China certainly Im doing a very large physical stimulus and credit stimulus and q1 that will take time to feed through and it seems like its the end of the year so I let my old coil last sentence at the recovery starts can a bit more traction sushipain on ice for a three-legged Cat Thats Italian Im out summary perhaps if it does seem to be a significant readingthis isnt the first time in many months that we get this reading so it is significant but I think it remains to be seen where it goes from here to Gaston back into the deteriorating quadrant do you know that 2q undateables distortedin the US and China and the business globally by number of factors and a inventory accumulation cycle was one of them and so some of the discussion is now washing out in the sun that scan buys todayto the upside down to the down side I think theyre at and the designs of subrogation but its too early to call to call that the green shoots definite Grinch voice to the recession in the skyenergize what we will see some civilization of holding your own this levels will likely see that over the next few months then the second half of the of this year is going to be a bit clearance of the direction that my base case is thatwe will avoid that for the slow down and and recession but the expansion the head is likely to be relatively subdued flight improving WellnessGris but is on a mentions again that the jury is out as to whether or not were just in transition from a growth phase into a proper credit-default cycle or whether thats been for stalled and we really will see a going to lastperhaps Final Phase of the expansion that were in at the moment we we certainly do take a little bit of additional constructive signal from the fly in that it probably means that the default cycle to getthe amount of ample liquidity provision has been provided by the central banks is not going to going to descend Upon Us in the next quarter or so but visibility beyond that into the end of the second half of this year and into the begin20/20 remains very limited as positive as I would expect to fixed-income chopped it to be maybe but the glass is always half-empty I dont think Ive ever had s p differing opinion I think eitherplay high school sports teams in the reading on the Fly before where we see a material Offspring and then it is let me see a further deterioration and that is an entirely plausible not even likely outcome as we said about Market sets with economies Witchwoodend of the cycle any question is how close we are to the end and of course were going to have a note Im off to the event I guess the other three to six months of you is somewhere between comfortable and Nina may be positive but beyond that and Tina Stone counselingwe come back to you piece of them because Im the high heels Market is often called the canary in the coal mine the coal face all you sing any worrying signals that only just a few at the moment but none of them seemed to have really developed into a proper containermechanism to infect the rest of their the capital markets so in a certainly we seen the risk-adjusted under performance of Triple C credits which are the most highly levered balance sheets that we can own in high-yield I investors are unwilling to dip down inthats low quality sector because it tends to be very highly levered to to growth and or the opportunity to it to refinance so if either one of those two pillars of performance is eroded from herewe would expect Triple Cs to to get hit first and investors reluctance to basically by everything in a dash for trash kind of style in so far in 2019 is a little bit of a warning sign the other one in emergingits clearly we have some ongoing rolling crisis in both Argentina and turkey but it seems to have been contained within those two jurisdictions for now could spill over its at some point but really requires additional external catalystdo some sounds more like a watching brief because it seemed fine versus as a defensive sex it is Health Care lines at Lake note for being a Haven A Safe Haventerrible performance yesterday the sector is done 11% compared to Global indices have some rigorous I just helped them Dodge the foolAlex senior portfolio manager with a focus on health care and difficult year-to-date what was going onturkey sit out a site is down about 11% each dates to the end of April and this real acceleration the last month I think the main Drive is behind that has being some of the political noise arrest for coming out in u.s.United are in the halfway the 2020 elections in November if ice is getting increasingly concerned about your Chi-Chis plural form from Healthcare Inspector General able to say drop prices andinsurance is all political pressure coming too bad thats right for this was a change in the state to 18% of GDP in the US spends on houseso its always a bright tropical in a hot. Compared to other countries in the majority of countries in the rest of Western Europe so these companies are looking real the Scatmanwhat this point is interesting is that the farmer and the managed care which is the u.s. health insurance in particular that has increased risk of the government intervention on the pricing would get into mediation on a shirt site things on todays companiesSperrys for some of the others in medical technology velocity tools companies exploration analyst who were looking at severance pay these concerns priestcome to you first of all that cool I mean Ive covered the managed-care sector among other stocks for 3 years and not involve living through the the 2016 election for these Managed Care stocks for where big winners from the Republican winHyundai the stocks performed very strongly out of that the hole. Since then that the issue is being we know that it could be risky into the next election thats an issue more of timing so when when do you start to question these companies that have very strong fundamentals and a stayschool nurse is the fact that the state of school could go away and actually theres no theres no business for them and honest insurance coverage off a of the populationthrough the commercial insurance and where it starts or stone that the government site at the government does it all like a like the NHS then theres no role for for these businesses and then the debate for Alex and others investing in this as I fart in that Spectrum do you gobecause there is another scenario where actually they can do more to help but yeah its its its life and death and what youll do on this on this particular aspect so without the benefit of covering they stops in the last election it was important for me to understand howTrident in previous elections so Im on Alice is really focused on how Managed Care tried in the last five elections and a revealed to me fiercely the risk is certainly there around Healthcare policy reform its was driven draw dance in the past and Hillary tweet is a great example of wheresentiment can a road and its second later that Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton with an incendiary tweet essentially on a hard drug pricing and even though Im an escapeddirectly related of course it was a fake to trading down 20% for the end of the year so we see that kind of sentiments affecting Managed Care in the past we also dont really see the reward that you would expect a rebound going into the election because the sentimentcant wait to hang campus cyst right through the election and if you do look at history you can also say to help get for reform the US tends to be at the story of incrementalism Rothman complete transformation so for that reason I came out slightly wet extremely bruised it on ultimatelyfo materializing but still very cautionary on political rhetoric affecting the sentiments and multiples of the Medicare six of cups or inspiring depending on whether a companyPioneer 10in in your portfolio is your hearing this voice from the Ethan Allen small lightweight Im in that sub-sectorthoughts and caution is very important because it Focus my mind on the issue as early as February not rather than any waiting paps until later on this year and not let me to adjust my PCthings down with you to have no no exposure at the moment. Im equate that sucked it into Mexico yes I meet Kuwait safe me enable HealthcareJava sexy and its about much more than just farmer and health insurers and by attack we have lots of good medical technology companies which makes the equipments in the hips and knees hearing aids for example of companies which is what forsend the fund is invested in having my opinion strong fundamentals much less price of risk because I already 6% of total government spend compared to fall Marissa to 12% and animals Caribbean Musgraves.okay well Alex free that you were very much indeed I would say it has been already for a few yearshow much is since before the 2016 elections out of course since then the whole brexit referendum it has been a busy so why why did ask about politicsa husband that is a bit quieter in particular with addresses and time Im being foolish to now to it was the end of this year but of course it hasnt gone the way so we have breast coming out of the European elections in a couple of weeks to you and thentheyre watching at what what happens afterwards with European commission leadership a Tetra and then well have the US elections coming up and I can painting with with the trade War tensions escalatingand that was us and thats something that will matter for the market of course theres a lot of noise and politics so as always it is very important to distinguish a signal and what actually matters for fundamentalsjust from noise at the most markets and that has headlines in you awake and noise on the front side from the regional and does seasonal issues that has mentioned he read it realits down to that a relationship between the the two Global superpowers and whether or not we are just in so late rounds Elite hands of a of a poker match or whether there is something a little bit more structural going on there anddid the Schism between China and the US and the outcomes for the leaders of both of those systems at the moment may actually be better in terms of their own ability to play to their base and reinforce their power by continuing to escalate isclose to reaching that an agreement quite quite quickly and in a clearly Market disappointment around that over the course of the last week is manifesting itself Yet Market still want to believe that over the course of the next four to eight weeks itll allokay and well have a resolution and were not in the midst of a massive geopolitical inflection and I think that thats just a little bit sad to underpriced at the moment I just to confirm that your place is now empty not even half emptywere not coming to the end of this podcast which means its time to play Hot Cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy a like a hot cake would you drop like a hot potato let me starts with you again HannahIm in the currency world I like the Swiss franc a good safe haven-pets against the basket of both the dollar and the euro to play the hero weakness potentially but this is a different kind of likethe dependency on which episode last time and by the way it has been quite well you have discussed this and I think the yields alreadyhello now theyre not supported by fundamental structure is anything that doesnt have a traditional Market exposure changes Cash Plus and you know that could be could beTimber Timbre strategy does something without Directbecause I dont think Nows the Time to have a directional positioning any you realize that cost Emoji drop I think I dropped and I was I was pondering the US equities and particularly Grace ormonde whatever you want to call it but but but unitech particularin general and I think that is that the market is at most. To property pricing in a six right resolution to the trade war with China and six to eight months is perhaps more likely maybe longer but that for I think the ideathat the US werent at least kept around partly from that is is is perhaps naive and actually there is a snoring which causes thinning acyclovir rewriting and rotational buy from the US that could be quite significant sir thats my Hope Stationfinal filled with you your cake what would you buy a hot cake would be generically anything that represents the kind of risk that we can buy in fixed income markets it looks an awful lot like what James is just advertisingis hotcakes so looking for stuff with strong acid cover strong Security package weve seen quite a lot of very interesting new issuance in the high-yield markets a year-to-date that has transitioned out of the loan Market has dust been looking tobrass itself in a different way from companies that are distressed within the high-yield markets but in exchange for that they need to offer up some additional security some better asset cover something that we can sleep more comfortably night withholding through the next downturn cycle cuz we expect that to recovery is going to be impaired in those Securities so for the moment thats why sort of generic hotcake free again with what James said on the text sizethats not necessarily reflected in in valuation valuations are pretty balanced in and Technology credits putting Telecom credit separately and US investment-grade Telecom that sector is trading pretty much at the time its difficult to see how muchtraditional spread compression you might get there or put another way the margin for safety in in those acid valuations is very limited the moment so I think that they could be considered a source of funds to buy something a little bit moresecure asset allocation if youd like more detail its published in full on our websites and if youd like to discuss anything we just thank you very much"
19,20,"this podcast is investment professionals Inc this is an Investors guideChina a new podcast from Fidelity International Im Parris Island head of asset management in asia-pacific and Ill be taking you deep into Chinas economy what makes a country chickthe areas of the most exciting and the ones to avoid Fidelity is built up Decades of experience in China in each episodebring you Fidelity portfolio managers research analyst and other Specialists who cover the market and can share with you that our expertisethe past year has been historic for Chinese Capital markets company share and phones have stepped into the international Spotlight included on global indices for the first time but how open is China really to investorshow far down the road of liberalization just trying to stand today and what should investors watchful next so help me Ill answer these questions Im joined by three of fidelity China experts with me in Shanghaiis Linda Jo a portfolio manager whos based in the city Linda youll pasted here by how long have you known Shanghai I went to Hong Kong for study and in for thein the last year its busy kid open up of the China markets bring me back so I relocate the whole family back to Shanghai after almost twenty years are joining us from Hong Kong we have Brian Collins a portfolio manager and headed our Asia fixed incomehow much does China figure in euro-asia portfolios on channel is a significant part of our portfolios directly and indirectly but you could easily account for half of the explosions that we have an end growing frankly and of course in.China has a significant influence on on Asia less the rest of the world has a portfolio manager in the multi-asset due to the Chinese market in recent years we haveon the shelves increasingly participating in China across the cops the cop structure whether it is China bonds cgbs so the safest part of the cup structure increasing the past year or so in China high heels and more recently in Chineseplease as well its so particular important for us in recent years thanks and thank you all for joining me today at Linda Fidelis hes been in China for decade-and-a-half and you know you can see that the Shanghai Skyline has changed beyond all recognition and not timethe countrys financial markets where are we not Journey interesting questions for now because we all know that China by far is still a relatively more close up Market you know we have to keep an account is duepretty much closed the financial markets is just a minute past two to three years to open up happening what is really encouraging is it in the past one year we do see that speed of open nap actually accelerate toa lot probably thats because its one of the negotiation conditions helped the trade War but were still very happy to see that process from your Bounty points in Hong Kong what shetake on the pace of change Brian I would say its a little mix. I mean its very rapid I mean I very much look at the domestic Capital markets in China and see them has not developed but rapidlyso in some respects the right of gross at the size of the market for one has been impressive I meant so I may have never seen this before in terms of the growth of a debt Capital Market or Capital Macklemore generally the good thing for ChinaScott Lodge established developed markets around the rest of the world which it can effectively mirror or at least reflect or take the best of if you will have seen some good improvements with the regulatory oversight especially aroundbanking system in around regulation Shadow banking for example in Shadow financing channels over the last couple of years in particular yet on the other hand there are some aspects little things which still have a long wayone of the obvious ones that we feel is significant for the onshore domestic Bond markets is simply allowing greater use of pretty basic derivatives like Bond Futures Government Bond futuresexample which are available and they used but for example as International participants were not yet able to use that as a some other participants now we feel that that will change and well obviously continue to develop in this always this balance between makethe development of any Capital Market is measured its controlled its not excessive or creating any kind of systemic risks but on the other hand given the size the fact today Bond markets 13 or treating youcolors in size we expect within the next five to six years that number to be easily 30 trillion US dollars in size that says big as the u.s. debt Capital markets so if you think about in size terms they going to be quite each other very soon but when you think about thatbrighten the sophistication of the two markets Chinas well well well behind so its got lots of room in opportunity to continue to grow so the development 07 the symptoms of the eye shadowpocket as well when we think about some of index inclusion at George when I when I look at the Chinese market despite the development of it the depth of its liquidity of the market volatility of the market still gives me the impression thatstill a very immature developing Market but whats your perspective on that it is a more retail driven Market the reason investors only show in China they responsible for roughly about 80% of trading server activity ofturn over when they hold about 20% of the outstanding these numbers are slowly changing with inclusion always so we are seeing a little bit of those Dynamics change its still very early days I think about 10%Elf Off fan of of the outstanding Services is held by by Ford investor so this will gradually change Dynamics and well have it posted impact and volatility but having said that Id also like to mention inclusion typicallywhat happens when a country gets included in an index you tend to have the buy buy the rumor sell the fact thats what happened with new UAE Qatar and Im going back with you to Taiwan and Korea certified many many years ago andcome around with China its been the exact opposite we we we we we knew that was going to be inclusion sometimes earlier this year we didnt know the extent of it but last year despite this earnings growth in China we saw ahuge huge compression of multiples so we didnt really see some of this fine fine room setting the fact that theyve been created a very interesting buying opportunity on the back of the attractive valuations after the dilation compareturn off last year the market is definitely becoming more interesting and last year and it was because you know we go to multiple surprises from both inside and outside I think outside one on the treadmill while its probably still going on butIm sorry YZF an Asian market deal average is almost to come to the end so it does look more interesting from now it looks like with trade rules for a bit and posed by the US on China and the retaliationby the way saying George how serious is this and how much of an impact is it having on your asset allocation views as is your sort of thinking through the portfolio is this a short-term situational something that you see kind of extending fullfour quarters ahead of us who trade was the key thing that we monitoring what is the impact on the Chinese economy and from our perspective word count understand from the bottom updoes it really mean a neighborhood has and today vs 10-15 years ago the impact of days vary by different because today the Chinese economy has managed to transition from an expert driven economy to one.play a big part of GDP growth is driven by the consumption story so three years ago would have had a much bigger impact than what it has today Id like to come in on currency though because I thinkone of the things I found pets of finding particularly surprising was how weak the currency was as we went through 2018 but despite all of these headlines around trade was when you have to look at the currency yeslittle bit of weakness but its been more resilient than one might have expected this week looks at 2019 value in the currency or do you feel that thats kind of fur the weakness to come hear the R&B is its in aholding currency at 8 for all intents and purposes its a managed trade-weighted currency and specially you can start to see how domestic monetary policy in China is playing a bigger role in the direction of currencyhe mentioned that it was weak during 2018 which was the reverse of 2017 versus the US dollar because monetary policy gross trajectories are actually diverging so thats what currency should do in 2018 the PVshe was easing monetary policy the usfed was actually starting to hike growth trajectory is between the two are actually starting to divulge the US was Stronger China was starting to moderate so you should see a currency behave that way like a natural stablethats what they do thats one of the great things about having a currency but I want to bring out this this this point on value I want to bring out a point on Friday I mean Linda when you look at the current cgc value of questions as in as an Insiderpeople always trying to do diversification because we see to cut expansion speed its so much faster it grows thats why I internalized I think domestic people always have a feeling you know fear of the currency divisionthats why they wouldnt took put the money into things like you know Im properties on or even how they curse you know but just not keep cash so in the context of your portfolio as you can you can bevegging out currency is a you hedging the currency of the moment we have been hedging the currency for the past month or so I take roughly two weeks before the trade with Shenanigans came back the surface and the reason for that is we sort of thought that the kind of see herturn the long way so far this year it was pricing in a lot of good news the hedging course as a result had come down quite significant about three and a half to 4% almost the entire coupon youd be gettingVons on the other hand instead of a month ago so they had called out to basis points from our end price and very good news and hedging post very very low we thought that was a good opportunity to reduce some of our remember exposure the interest-rate differentials if completely cansearch between the R&B and the US between China and the US excuse me so I thought as hedging cost in negligible now I wouldnt say this value in the car and see only because there a downside risks there are psychological barriers if you willtickly for the domestic consumer and domestic confidence that seventies that is an issue but frankly it should be able to break through that if China needs to be able to adjust to a relatively high level of debt to GDP if it needs touse that as a tool within the trade War negotiations maybe but currencies need to go up and down to be a natural stabilizer and the problem is with a close Capital account with a with a man is currency its ability to dohas both very strong pros and cons but it calling me more. I mean one of the things International investors really struggle with Linda results trying to get a read on the Chinese economy I mean from inside the company whats your view on where wein the business cycle how do you get a read on the on the economy so some of a easy even for the domestic person because is extended to really reflect you know how the economy chainso we do have some better indicator seems like a power generation seems like a discretionary spending out on some of the key items I think its more kind of close to the reality type of parameters and also I haveall right so I I talk taxi Im so it is shed on system twice a day so I guess yeah thats actually quitevalue for that cuz we still got a lot of Internet giant subsidized on that shed car on service so I talked to drivers to I said that the interesting thing is these taxi driver is Dan. Futon taxi drivers most of time to have another joband quite some time that actually SME owners you know so at that they should time to Candice Earth some additional measurement companies give you the video firsthand kind of information of whatAriana Grande like for example one of the driver I may remember last year and he raised pigs and then lost it yeah you know it in his business and he was sicktomato sounds business and then you know switch to another one so thats typical of The Twelve of the cycle of the of the pig market and how did you act on that me what should you do on the back of that informationusually that will give you some idea of going to win the kind of Turning Point and it also it give you your it just give you an idea so after that I need to prove that I talked to the really big scale pick Rising companies to see if thatUniqlo City the down cycle of the market I think that probably gives me some of them information earlier you know a quicker before I really picked up some news from from you know the Bloomberg report its reallywhats happening formation what are the things that Im really interested in the moment is really the role that kind of monetary policies playing and I mean Brian I dont know how effective you sing the Chinese authorities have been in terms of the use of a monetary policy to manage theeconomy should vote the the folks at this Little Peoples Bank of China should they be talkin to sort of the pig Farmers as well for what its worth Im sitting they are because thats an important component of inflation its food in particular is a big part ofthe Consumer Price Index and its just a big part of the disposable income and I think what would notice with the pboc is that their monetary policy framework they formalized open market operations have really stepped up quite meaningful in the last couple of years from officiallyNovember of 2015 tree policy is now becoming a much better tool and you can monitor that true again the formal open market operations you can look at it with short hair and funding costs so this is actually a much better indicator wesay of what the central bank is actually doing rather than just what they saying and so you can actually start to see over the last couple of years that tightening of monetary policy the easing of monetary policy are the 2017 and 18 respectivewere very clear to see and it helped us without positioning it helped us get conviction that helped us to add risk at the end of last year and the other thing that hangs very relevant to that it so very interconnected as you can imagine is oversee the currency in interest-rate differentials we talked about that beforebut then its even just look at the credit impulse that that credit growth within the within the economy this is critical in assessing and evaluating the Cycles in the mini cycles that we see within China or very related to each othermonetary policy is not just credit crows we also need to add things like fiscal impulse or local government spending for example George again in a sentence with alsoquestion I look at you despite lots of different economies and governments talkin about macro-prudential measures You could argue actually the Chinas been one of the most effective at using macro-prudential measures to controlcall Daniela am I right in thinking that last year we have had the deleveraging campaign and that has been working but at the same time it has also had some unintended consequences and actually.play much too to watch the plan talked about you the credit cycle in the cut it so they could impose what happened last year was that companies that needed liquidity that needed credit flow the most private companies in a small and medium-sized Enterprisethese companies did not have access anymore to lending and as a result we started seeing an increase of defaulted more more spread volatility in the bond market and thats importantbecause small and medium-sized Enterprises in China do private companies in China they make up a big part of Chinas employment about 70 to 80% of urban employment and if you think of New Chinaand youre the political Spectrum in China they keep the keys to the felt rejected here is I would say social stability how we can relate to that to the economy something more tangible that we can money I would argue that is employmentCentral note saying unemployment Rising if private companies are having issues and not issued because theyve been poorly managed but issues because they not finding access to liquidity then that is a bad thing because it can be to Rising unemploymentnow that was identified as an unintended consequence by the market by the by the pboc middle of last year they started stepping up on that front and as a result from my perspective that was a catalyst to startthing to risk especially in Chinese culprits and the macroprudential policy that weve also saying which I think is a little bit mixed but I think youre right Paris its its been a pretty good example of how I can work at Sunny its Kyle thats for sureanother many years is quite extensive policy controls around the property market around lending standards thats actually created some distortions frankly its a mix result if you will be other macroprudential policy itsprobably hes torturing and stretching the term of the definition of little bit its just really being about the cost of funding so the overall cost of funding the allocation of capital within the economy has been very heavily skewed toward state-ownedthen we could cause through Decades of Rapid development this is a necessary very valid way to create Capital to generate fixed asset investment infrastructure and everything that goes with it the problem however is overtime if the cost of capitalits not price correctly you didnt get a misapplication of capital and one of the nice things that we see about the development of a domestic bond market is that it starts the process of pricing Capital betta and when you price Capital betterhigher chance of that Capital being allocated more efficiently its not perfect it just means that good quality companies get rewarded with a lower cost of finding and vice-versa its a work-in-progress the bond market helps you do that thatsI would argue the number one Financial microphone for China the efficient pricing and allocation of capital and the bond market helps with that but they still a lot more to be done and not just the bond market or so you think Lucien of China intothe population this is a Tetra which will slowly fine International institutional investors Im coming to the market and again helping with pricing. Risk more efficiently misallocation of Capital Pointe at this time I broughthes a negative very different feelings cuz you know from the recent like at April to pay bills monthly commentary already feel that they started to tighten a little bit after you know the first quarter verbix get off easy answer to this time around that damn itits very different and I just want to control the liquidity enough to support economy collapse but they dont want to to Really pom the serpent this is some ways a band of liquidity in and create a lot of typos or another.another word allocate capital in a very inefficient way so so I think its also kind of mentality and attitude change and towards the easing and and definitely that brings more credit financing to direct Equity financing of bond financingI brought you mentioned prophecy and traditionally properties where up to 70% of Chinese household wealth is tied up and my colleague has hit the streets in Shanghai to see whats happening in the property Market what that could actually mean for the broader economyParis Im in downtown Shanghai the center of the pudong business district if I could just outside our offices you can probably wave and Id see youarent you going to ramble to see some of the different areas different neighborhoods at the story they tell about Chinas economy today oh my God is that exchange Fidelitys real estate continuewhats an exciting time to be covering real estate I know that you think that Shanghai is a little bit like China and miniature if you could call the city like this in 26 million people in anyway midi but tell me about the development here in this business district what we looking atright now sure we are now standing in the very center of loot at we Financial town and theyre around forty Beauties in this area and in those what buildings we have over 200,000 people working for the financial industry 30 years ago what was here filled and some very shabby neighborhood and then when the Chinese government decided to develop Uno area as the starting point of the opening up and then we start to see a lot of shootingssome of them up with Beauty in the 1990s but also some of them appeared in the Toussaint answer this is possibly the the scene thats most people think of when they think of with the Shanghai youre going tomake sure all the different place yes of course for the residential community in this route of the area where two camps one is around to 5 to 10 minutes walk from our office and the other is around 20 minuteswhat kind of office and Im actually living in the 20 minutes Camp some exercise to to get some with Elite onquite Alex zurdo philosopher exercise weve only been working for payback on a 7 or 8 minutes and here we are in the area that you were telling me about much more residential is leafy we got lots of trees down the street very attractive and helpful.sunny day here in Shanghai tell me about restaurants coffee bars juice bars and I think these represents the fast-growing Service Industrialso definitely is a structural Tramp Iver we can also see all of these tenants the turnover rate is very high but sooner is all the churn rate so which means to some people trying to open nail shops however some people succeed toto survive but some people just have to close down I just have to maybe you did the tenant leaves. I have to say very often extra if on the busscreenshots I didnt even found it during the last weekend well it depends I see the property agents probablylost car up here its because they are the expert about so the amount and this dumpling shops I think they mainly serve the mid-to-low and customers can actually also survive quite a lot of all timeone which is stood me kind of shops specific so Im not quite sure how long they can survive maybe dontquotient is prophecy as an investment to people here in Shanghai 30% in 2015 and another 30% into a 16 but after the two years so skyrocketingthe chance, Hemingways intervention to curb poly bubble in lights 2017 so we 15% drop from the peak and which buttons fabre this year and a job for 6% season is edging up 6% credible racing raveIm has not changed the way that people think about property well its definitely the property has become less attractive as an investmentbecause I bought some I apartments in this area already turned 16 so I enjoy it are really into a 16-5 I also experienced a drop into 17 and 18 evenly I dont view that as a problemmango lime or treat as a living purpose Bible its also prevent the property to crowding out too much consumptionI think there will definitely be a structural trend for the Chinese household to allocate their assets out of property and The Graduate into other type of ss like Equity fixed income and outer type of things and also on the other hand you havemore disposable income be allocated to consumption so thats definitely pose good for the capital markets and consumption for the next decades leafy streets of almost Central820 Bremerton to eat Monroeville Expo this point Alex raised on consumer Trends a bit more this is what he said really trying with Euro not look into thinking that way butfrom my kind of experience I I actually do feel the opposite way I think that you know you have your property prices for I think its actually curious lot of wealthy fact and increase your force of increase your consumption power in second is also increase you expectfor the future grows so I dont think that wealthy fact takes a big part in from the puppy price its going to probably quite good for the for the consumption and also you know I do experienced a very big drop in Hong Kong publicbacking 297 when the property price drop to 70% so thats definitely going to increase their consumption increase Wellness things are discovered the last year is that it seems as iflocal brands starting to resonate with consumers all Ghibli more than International bands and were were very used to this idea that International Brands like Nike have Global residence but but whats really surprised meprominence and growth and appetite for local Brands is this is a real shift whistling it is a very strong phenomenon virgin and in any of the past decade or two reasons behind that first one is you havecocoa Brands is really have their quality improved in terms of value for money it can give you a better utility so theres fundamental reasons why you know the local bands in the emergent and second also from the consumer perspectiveYoung Generation their conception pattern is different from my generation sound and TaylorMade demand and also very focused on experience and focus on a kind of interaction ofbe back so that sometimes you in a good local bands the really good apps and theyre very fast and changing them motoza designs the better and tailoring that the younger generation customers where is international Brands quick dump it straight to the example is like a PNGwhen they want to launch a new product and trying to fit into the younger generation they need strands of process approval from the US based there and I need Center by the local Cosmetics are all fmcg brands to change.what are the emerging stories really that was about increasing household leverage on the credit side brightness is is increasing how so boring a concern for you the level of household debt is always something we need to be thinking about in any economya particular around the rate of change someones property or properties plural as is often the case within China and the mortgage Associated to that is is typically the largest part of that household debt that wealth effect and everything that wastoo bad hes obviously an important part of that they could sing is generally speaking we dont see excessive levels of debt in the household sector other than the investors and even then its being difficult to have excessive amounts of debt with in the housegold sector but as we start to think about things like what are releasing for example if we start to think about the use of consumer credit this is a much tricky a part of the household that problem cuz usually at the High Cost of funding its usually brings food canand and of course its hard for that to sustain rapid growth and that actually is what brings about cyclic ality with in more developed economies like the US for example which is very much domestic driven weight with a large amount ofcredit focus and household debt Focus I mean the development of China credit scoring systems of social scoring systems it is clearly a way to try and rein in and self-regulation if you will but I guess Im not concerned about household leverage at this point of stage but my goodness itsits increase quite significantly over the last few years that Stephanie something we need to be watch Indian mindful of one more thing to drink up to that is in the morning during household leverage levels but simultaneously monitoring savings rates levels which historically and continues to beone of the highest globally if thats Tan City rating at a time when household limited is moving upwards without would be a move worrying Dynamic havent really seen that yet happening any meaningful way Brian this rise very quickly.my feeling is that is still pretty much links to the mortgage the mortgage dance is still so far the largest apart of the household leverage so again you know it links back to the question of property price my view is property prices going to be statelook up sink and as long as its the case I dont think and its a mortgage type of household average is going to be a big problem today is that the Chinese marketCapital markets are continuing the process of opening up a really weve seen the pace really accelerate over the over the last 12 months to hear that I love you on the management of thecalling me about the Chinese authorities were getting all the credibility for both the efficacy of monetary policy as well as the Prudential measures and whilst were seeing a mature bring real estate cycle and potentially accountmixed outlook for Real Estate but in fights the the consumption story continues apace of course well be keeping a very close eye on pics that brings us the end of all show today Id like to thank my guests Lindgren Alex in ShanghaiGeorge in Hong Kong The Producers were

20,21,"this podcast is investment professionals Angley hello and welcome back to Rich picking switch out a seized asset allocation podcast join me on a very wet June day here in the city of London on Sheltering Armsrain outside the views we have inside bespoke post anything bus driver vestment teams have made a significant shift away from risk we discuss why in this episode have us China trade war is waiting on that thingall politicians leading us to economic Armageddon or when markets take it all in their stride listen on to find out more with me in the studio to distill this monthallocation or when when Lindros lead cross asset strategies and James Bateman our chief investment officer welcome to the usual left-field question that reveals the realthis month can you tell me the one thing that you prefer to do the old-fashioned way. I prefer today to do the old fashioned ways reading never been able to get on board with e readersbooks is wild and given that Id I travel a lot means that Im Im normally carrying it excess baggage excess baggage when Im reading a book called The Road to character by Davidand its about some 20th century figures they embody characteristics that are really centered around Civic values and improving Society but without seeking celebrity so old-fashioned civil valuetime for you and James Warburton you can rely on me to take things from the deep and meaningful to the shallow and superficial so I would say makeup towels because I couldnt resist upon Excellence okay whatever you said it so I didnt have to get to the asset allocation.you Isaac read across all of the asset classes at when when take a significant risk and even though the underlying economic andhaters are decent we are concerned about trade War impacts as well as valuations so specifically inequities for the near-term view weve gone from neutral to underweight with in government bondscome under way too overweight on the near-term over the medium-term view weve gone from underweight to neutral and then within corporate credit weve gone from overweight to neutral both in the short-term in the medium-term so in some this reflectsare more defensive posture given the risks that were facing it is so not you know it from my perspectivebut it could be looked at in some ways as a position that reinforces the kind of risk of perspective but actually when you think about what is driven Marcus especially Equity markets over the last few months its really been linked tostop this position that the FED has is taken so even if for example you had a more constructive view on the macroeconomy which I which I personally do but if I look at one market security pricing in today which is actually further awaystation from the fattest. Fails to come through than that in and of itself will be quite bearish for market so Im Im Im very supportive of the view from that perspective in a sense that you do not know. Just if if we we end up in the recovery environment but actuallyif we end up in a in a in a tightening environment that we dont expect okay and changed took a nap at the house for you and which is made out of fuse across the other teams across the asset classes as head of multi-asset does it reflect your views andApril Eagles yes Richard so I think you know that the timing and then you want to sit at your home with a multi-asset so we took to continue my my flippancy we did sell in May rather than June the other that was I got a random timing meetingMay events that you know on the one hand them activated looks okay and that she could be good but the reality was Marcus I got ahead of themselves I will write a bit about valuation to move very worried that the trigger If the Fed was on you going to ever be to the deathI dont see outside to pick up my view the James reflected on on valuations because to me that is one of the common denominators around all of these decisions will be taken so you look at the the house for you. Kind of when when is laid out and you can say it isflights in totality of a risk-off position but I should look at the underlined decisions and I think the one thing that supports the mold is the fact that we are seeing little value in many of the asset classes across the Malcolm so thats that. Thats one waylooking at 50 c because I want two things that struck me is that the fly this is a leading indicator always comes from your team James thats looking remarkably positive in the doldrums for as long as I can rememberno hustling into positive I missed connection but it said he doesnt drive it andmaybe that my pretzel duration is willing to the price of markets already on the second issue is almost by definition leading indicators are trying to predict the future I never reasons why you believe it and the reasons why you might have some caution around that and that fool would say that the extent of the positivity of showingmy man is hes probably higher than the reality in the discussions that scrumptious to to this point I was pretty the main threads that you remember from that were spending a lot of time analyzing the trade war and I would say that this is somethingnot necessarily captured and fly and things can happen on such a short notice now with Trump tweeting about the trade war and escalating the situation on May 5th so this is new information that wouldnt necessarily have beenJordan fly but it has huge ramifications for what will happen throughout throughout the rest of the year when we think about positioning we think about risks like tick spray for excetera you have to come if you relateddevaluation of Heritage point that when valuations that reasonable the downside risks to to some unexpected news for a movie from increasing Towers Federal some some escalation that its a Maria its not major Wyoming on risk assessscratched Im the downside risk is really quite High I think were in that position the reason why risk of party is because there are clear binary downside risks that could be quite big on markets given by the Russians won the most interesting things that came out in all discussion weedshould have dissected the shape of markets over the last few months was really the the known follow through in terms of flow so even though Market action has been very positive we havent seen the kind of flows towards risk assetswould give you that security that this is something that that didnt show the feel fragile as exactly is is James said whether its its trade War weather is something else that was just that feeling of fragility around the bull market I like a substanceas well as another thing that has a remarkable turnaround to signals from the US Federal Reserve which until recently was implying that would be a hike on the horizon and now its indicating it be willing tohow to interest rates to offset any damage from those trade Wars and ignoring inflation that might be coming from a triangle with one right now. That thats a remarkable turnaround 2018 of the market was pricing on a fewnew heights for a 2019 I mean at this point were looking at a total of 80 basis points of of cuts priced into the treasury markets so its been a very rapid turnaround and I would say that this is partlydue to the very quick pivots and policy that do come from the very top President Trump so the signals around US inflation have been pretty muted here to date and the FED is doing some work in terms of how they want to endis it going forward from a personal perspective I do think that inflation is set to rise because of the tariffs and because of the tight labor conditions but this is a question that is out there in the market that people are trying to answer but you surprised I suppose if infectionrise because the prices have been passed onto American consume as a moment to think about the impact of the trade was themselves on their own economic pray you gave her medicine t a p that look on the impacts of thisclassic disputes I know that youve been looking into the impact of the trade War whether it is a war between China and the United States and its lowest statetax if this trade War remains confined to the ocean China I meet you think it wouldnt be the killer blow to to the rest of the world was that even the worst case scenario25% tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and Chinese talietian we think over the next two years. Probably takes off 9.2% to 9.3%u.s. GDP growth and clearly more in China props more like 0.5% or even one percentage points next year and thats meaningful but its also small enough for manageable enough.policies to not trade policy but fiscal policy on credit policy can offset its so if it does come to pass that you said how should people try and understand the impactI got to have that say on on the US economy is that the US consumes about seven and a half billion barrels of oil every year thats roughly cost about four hundred eighty billion.Batman with all prices and not for Haiti billion dollars is very close to the total amount of imports that the US takes from China so if hes just to explain is buying as much oil as it does goodanything else from China so that that roughly equivalent in a sentence yes so if you think about a 25% shocked they all the price thats about $15 higher and oil and the Tariff is basically a Price Chopper so $15no it does hit growth certainly its a hard and put cost but it doesnt believe people screaming that were about a major recession and so for me thats thats the comparison that Im making my hat so we were able to weather thethe ups and downs of oil prices and what what kind of used to that we should maybe think about it Im Terrace in the worst-case even in the worst-case as Im being some similar experience so sick of stars breakwhat about data from China whats that telling you about its ability to cope with the effects of a trade War so we have seen all going to start this year a significant slowdown in Chinese they say actually Im since about Februarythings have stabilized slightly improved and most of that slow down was I sure laces to fiscal and credit policy that started from China domestic almost a year ago not if you thinkits loaded I was fat fiscal Inns and credit policy that also gives you a sense of how much leeway they have to re stimulate the economy to help contract some of the effects of trade Warwere already seeing a significantly increased same as out of China and the first quarter of this year and given the increased tensions the the chance of that extending even further Im his only reasonhe was saying that the impact of taxes roughly equivalent to what I have to tell you that sitting here in the studio when when will check on trade War impacts versus oilI think that when oil goes up you have beneficiaries like e&p companies and oil producing countries there are periods of time like 2006 or 08 or 2012 through 41 Toyota prices went up and it did nottrain Global growth on the other hand trade Wars I think that most people would agree that the impacts are just broadly negative and there arent really any winners only losers in coming out of the trade tensions Trump thinks hes winning#when there are political winds to be made you are absolutely right in both this is so important to consider but in terms of economic impacts trade times translate to Tiger Financial conditions number onelower business and consumer confidence number two So eventually there has to be a negative impact seen in the real economy because of trade tensions in the results of his analysisTexas risks to that if I if I pick up all the one to the point of optimism that when made with cheese at the Rock political wins to be had I actually think that maybe the political winds to be hot from moves like this will probably less thanpeople think and suddenly less than President Trump thinks in the end and the logic goes as follows is that you throw up in the ass the terms of trade between two significant economic blocks and you think that they can be resolvedthe kind of time frame that mirror is the time the time frame of the inauguration of the other kind of the launch of the of the issue and then well see what happens though is that when you thinking about and its true as true as bright as it is true off that the China and usis it the devil is old in the detail and not detail is painstaking detail that takes far longer to sort of workouts so what might seem like a political win in the in the beginning my at Tri-C political Capital be warnedas you go through the pro side comparison with brexit and surely if you wanted to see an example if were throwing trade deals up in the air and then hoping youre going to be able to switch it to have before they full time UK we switch time that that isnt as simple as asexactly and you can also you can also count the political cost of that to to to the Toyota dealership in the other point that I would make is that Wasa think that the the context of the input surround it with the old price makes a lot of sensethat is presuming that youre dealing with a relative be bounded problem so youve got that you want to know a price and you can see the impact on it the issue for markets with something like a trade war is it is very hard for us at this point to bound the problem you cant even filemaking some assumptions about u.s. versus China but I cheat when you think about this as a as a sort of a trade scratchy more broadly what about the impact on Mexico what about the impact on Europe thats the issue from all kisses you compound it in the same wayhow are you looking at how this might unfold in terms of impact on Cooper dunnings I think there is a downside and I just want to pick up one thing on the on the oil price which is of course you can presume Amadeo price that is writing found in that for even if its my one year it might be worthtext yet the risk is with with tariffs is you could have a situation whether the current level becomes the low and the high for the next five years that Katie is economically very consequential but if that has parasites move globallyabout as we talked about but we also worried about specific area since active some Maris I saw what could be impacted by surprise or maybe not surprised tariffs so we look maybe slightly cover in sign that weve been onlast time to some time on the on the basis of Oswego like Emerging Markets Im underweight. Time with them. On the basis of concerns about around and Terrace in that area where was so very short European photos Im not going to fix the same thesis that thethere is a and there are other reasons Too Short lyrics want to know if youve heard from a tariff what if its a very easy pain point in and what we see from Trump is put tariffs on first negotiate later which is very much the opposite of traditional trait switches leave them insulation threat someIm alone but that dont save it so you could see overnight tires put in place on something that then brings Europe to negotiate some type of stimulus from the effects of the market pricingfull cast Versailles Paris kids Authority and do in China for example I would like to be with a B-2 to step up their attempts to it to keep the Chinese economy taking over this really does begin to to bitefind Feebas that I see most domestic government central banks continuing a stem stimulation path for their domestic economies which is why I am more optimistic about the global macroeconomicthe many of my colleagues and I think that they do this in part because they understand the political and economic cost of pursuing a more nationalistic agenda so its almost a quid pro quobut I do see the weights of a stimulus as we look forward be much more on terms of the physical side then on the monetary side simply because in a monetary policy I think is largely played out as a stimulus and has ashe resulted all Ghibli in some of the imbalances that have lead to the focus on the national state political agenda how does that then play right when youve got men sets Im a pretty much indebted to run the worldtheyre going to have to borrow more in order to fund their social fiscal stimulus spending is going to increase from here basically to satisfy populistwhich has emerged around the world and this is going to elevate that to GDP ratios. Your crisis was know that well talk through incenseVenta de and even bigger crisis didnt necessarily worry about imbalances as we talked about and I know if I needed to the same previous podcast my biggest concern is social cohesion in the end the gap between rich and poor at actually its the gap between the upper quartile in the lower quartilethis is this is this just been this enormous bifurcation of winners and losers Griffin pot. Going to replace the other things and The Grace Of The Lost decade for individuals individuals in society that has to be done through fiscal policygoing to do it it seems very small price to pay to issue more debt to do that and I actually think Marcus would be a positive and positive on that move. Imprudently by the rights of the politicians are so you agree I do that director a couple of points I would make one is thatwe think about this ratio the people quote which is debt to GDP that is a that has kind of limited explanatory power because youre comparing the stalk which is the the Quantum of that with the flow which is which is GDP I see if you look at theconsulate at versus the cost of servicing the debt Archie debt-servicing costs a very low at the moment so the affordability of our larger and larger balance sheet to King just now about inflation Rising as a result oferase that youre going to see a significant bump in my personal view on this is that because of the conditioning around inflation because of the conditioning of open-market the both on markets andcentral banks will be very slow just to pick up on this and Im also have this view that it is harder and harder to measure the modern economy and hence the views on inflation to publish dates on employmay not keep you by Acura picture on what actually happening at prices on the line so Id like to be to where we are today back to the US in the 1920s 30s and 40s the level of inequality in the US right now is akin to whathad in the 1920s that was followed by the election of FDR who introduced the New Deal to get people back to work and so what were seeing and from the progressive left in the u.s. today is the introduction of the green New Dealand if they are like policies but ultimately that isnt what solved the problem in the US have an equality and slow growth Etc it was World War II so looking at it from sort of a broader perspective we may beheading for a larger type of a reckoning it is recognized that inequalities get solved or cured in a way by either war or disease but on a more positive note we also think that a third Industrialrevolution could get us out of this rut but even pericings mean significantly more optimistic in thisIm conversation is different in the message the Great Depression if we draw the productwhere are the different timing sequence events can unequivocally redress balances and in fact you know World War 1 had a similar impact in a little respect theyre two very simple frankincense examples weathershe is there lots of other ways to address balances and I think either political will to do so some actors can you find out sometime but it is impossible to deal with that in Paris alluded to it how to measureyeah, it is a lot easier to measure and understand sentiment and whats making people unhappy most creating unrest am I thinking of that it itself is probably a difference from the past the rise of Twitter everyone having a voice is an inherent summon a wonderful but you can really understand and measure what peoples benefits all that concerned that hes very clever problems are now Im an inequality is very very solvable through through effective fiscal policyreducible through affect fiscal policy I think governments are waking up to the well thats up listing so it should I remove no to poly game of hot cakes and hot potatoesyou buy it like a hot cake and what would you dropped like a hot potato let me come to when when first what are you takes so Im going to go long populism and short neoliberalism the trades through questionshit me with it. I would go long populist and by going long volatility so going long the VIX Index either 3 TSR options or simply by the riskone sport fire index yes exactly and then the second is my expectation that inflation in the US is going to rise More Than People expect on a combination of tariffs and the quiet tight labor marketso I would go along real duration in tips as a play on inflation and then on the short and I would play populism in the US by going shorts or underweight Healthcare stocks specificallyManaged Care in Pharma and then in the UK I would short a basket of UK utilities which are obviously a focus of the Labour party here at about you you will cakesshort to medium some cake and a cyclone the same ones too short to medium time is gold and I think that reflects the general sense of risk aversion in mock hits Im about to go to the pump to them not doing much for some time and the fact that it is by the store valuefastest moving in panic so Im not one of you I think I can go to the other side I do think we have to smoke to come from the reality that is truly green Trinity environmental Im is like to have a meeting about performance and weatherhes going back to a level tentative wind and solar leasing out with something but those are the various medium-term I think you almost kind of ascribe that long time value because Im that the world is clearly shifting in that directionthe green Hulk cakes and yellow potato potato not necessary for environmental reasons though that you could you could bring Bill Galvin is all well Im concerned about while Im concerned because I didnt resist looking too good on the routes you can relax goodand I think Supply constraints the weather that if you look through the next year Ill probably last me how you put the two together and that feels like a damaged directory for oil parasite me come to you you okay so I go to OK Google what exactlyboth of them contrarian both of them in some ways a line to this view that we all going to move into a phase of our fiscal spending and the world in general is going to perform better macroeconomic season think consensus so Im I thinksing a song / think its nothing is structurally undivided versus on the trade way to basis and sudden you cant see a dollar I know soon in terms of the US I think that thats been this long bifurcation between gross and buy you if we haveinfrastructure spending if we see more wage inflation domestically in the US which will I think lead to about a consumption picture in in the middle, I think I need to be a lot of names in US values of the word, testing down in having a look at as a result of medium to him I do think that the kind of issuance needed to support the infrastructure spending and and the fiscal spending will will put downward pressure on the dollar and then secondly kind of more ChapaI do think that one the things that were learning from from reading the newspaper is the risk of holding a liquid positions in a liquid trade vehicles and I I think I did they just in case people dont away in the UK was working and lost it back thereplay sometime his funds that Im in trouble Man live in case it to redemptions liquids obts exchange-traded funds which offbut you know instant liquid is heated to buy holders but I do think that as you dig into some of those funds would have been launched there are some the hold actually relatively low liquid prepositions tonight I think that that is an area that I would talk to be looking to godont you trouble ahead okay well thank you very much indeed Paris and I hope thats given you listening and insight into the thinking behind speak your Fidelity contact thanks for a Mercedes my gas whenJames Paris and thanks for listening goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on byit invests this podcast is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switch to send it must not be reproduced or any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of Investments can guy down at the weathers up so you mayget back less than you invest all the important legal nights this please see our website professionals.
