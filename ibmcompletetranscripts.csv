0,1,"first of all I have to warn you this podcast is for investment professionals only that you join me tucked away in our offices in chemistries in London as we careen towards deadline for latest addition of fidelity own sis this time is on the topic of risk and had to take it wisely what youre about to hear was recorded in October twenty seventeen but its just as relevant today we want to look at what developed markets can learn from emerging markets hello political risk is some things investors in emerging markets have to take in their stride or at least prepare for the second punch when it comes but we live in interesting times and political risk is everywhere you look in developed markets as well from an unpredictable US president to elections in Germany and person ends the yet to be determined impact of brings it all with or is it with ours Russian interference its enough to make your head reel and its been making some developed market currencies fall more volatile than theyve been in the past well Im joined by two fidelity portfolio managers arena Karina selection who runs UK equity funds and on the line from Singapore is onyx Duffy he manages an emerging market fund hello to both hello read it with a recording this discussion in the way if an unfolding political scandal in Brazil which Sanchez down ten percent within I was on the currency the ram another eight percent loan was stunning hasnt quite thrashed around like thats but its still about twelve percent weaker against the dollar than it was the day before the brings it very last year Im how significant are currency news for you hello becoming  increasingly more significant so then before brexit we werent used to seeing currency moves of more than four or five percent a year or as you know about a year ago now suddenly we had a very large within the peak to trough of one sixty to one twenty with was you know very large compared to  anything Ive seen before in my investing career so its something that  I definitely am having to spend more time thinking about now than the Houston and addicts I I presume that this is a large poster of fun of your work as well yeah it its integral to the roots of the research process identical to provide a construction when it comes to emerging markets is is stress test in on the good companies the changes in its origins factors like currency is it like more the prices like interest rates so it so it is it is a critical part of the investment process with an emerging markets led released Serena Im can you explain what the what the dangers aw  tuple failure when you see Im a currency  impact as as as as we are as you just described with some with stunning yes so the first thing that we we think about and weve always thought about even prior to the larger moves this year is is ready to look at the currency exposure of the pool for so the UK is one of the most international markets in the world only about one third of foot see profits come from the U. K. so weve always thought about  a portfolio exposures to the dollar to emerging market currencies but historically its been more to manage exposures to emerging market currencies that that the fresh about a bit more rather than  worry about sterling which has been relatively stable historically Im and whats new for me of the last twelve months is really like Alex has been dead on emerging ma its having to think about the impact of moves in sterling on the panel of companies  for retailers that hedging strategy is something that weve had to really focus in on and give a lot more  time to than we were used to we will to have to consider  exporters and the impact that changes in sterling will have on that pricing and that four levels of profitability so having to go down until close colleagues in emerging markets and maybe take on board some of the techniques theyve been using for years Alex can you tell us some of those some techniques was what what do you do how do you deal with it well I think really are when I do a currency that I do it in three core wise at a stock level  and actually a cool a sovereign level as well the first is really to consider the operational impact that the currency has  on the on its power business so the ring related to water the PNL impacts of currency movements how they change margin structures  and also some businesses profits actually being flat by a particular currency environment that that that actually may be susceptible to change so so thats really the first impact is two one is is to understand the underlying cash generation and how they get impacted by by currencies the second is to have a good look at but she structure  and this is probably more of an issue for emerging markets that often you see situations where companies will boroughs in in cheaper currencies typically euros sterling and all US dollars and then invest the that that that debt into emerging market assets and when those cash flows from the assets dont match the the the currency in which the interest  has to be paid back that can lead to severe problems for equity holders went when the cars move round so theyre really stress test the balance sheets to make sure all the the cash flows and access the death is is is equally matched and then just just finally a sovereign level its really about on the stand in  what the what the risk to to to to current these are as a consequence  and government balance sheets as a consequence of currency price movement so it is this three key areas that I look at what arenas and then we come to you on the second point annex right there by the idea of boring and one currency  but you   you endings in another that that mismatch its not something that that that happens in the U. K. or is that is that something much more for emerging markets its much more for emerging markets because in the U. K. I. weve got deep and liquid  deadlock cuts in and most of the sees the companies operate and so you have a good match between profits  Im borrowing said that something we dont have to worry about an area where companies have been called out is more on the hedging so having costs and revenues  and in different currencies and the best example was sports direct  who for some bizarre reason decided not to hedge sterling even though they buy all of that  products in dollars and cents three days off the bat brexit they came out and said that  they hadnt hedged and with the Im having fallen from one sixty two and one thirty  that they were going to have a significant decline in profits as a result , and this is something that you know wed assumed that that they would have been hedging so our analysts such very quickly ring round all of the other retailers just make sure they had a sensible hedging strategies and in place not most of most of them date below a one or two exceptions  who like sports direct maybe havent thought it through as as much as they could tough surveys seemed a bit too much and perhaps   invest this in the U. K. might also have been assuming too much as well until now yes and I think we weve just had a wake up call that work that into hedging is something that we need to be having conversations with companies about regulate whereas a year or two ago it was maybe its the passing comment at the end of the meeting Im all these costs that are going to be postponed to customers  war on the company that you look at it they have to suck it up themselves well thats a really interesting question and one that  , is going to determine the profit up that so many of the retailers over the next few months so where we are today is companies who have had have been covered so they havent had to pass costs on to date  but that hedging is running out really as we speak so over the summer will find out companies have the ability to pass on that those rises to customers and which dont and I mean some interesting examples already so called put retailers have managed to pass on the cost to customers without any problem weve seen that happen already and thats really because because Mr know the price of copper wire as food retailers  for instance every time they raise prices it really is under scrutiny so we saw the  into the press interest over the price of marmite a few months ago so I think its going to be a lot more difficult  for comfort as well as the price of the goods is hardly transparent to pass that on to customers where is if pricing is a bit more opaque no one really knows what a square foot of carpet cost you can probably get that through without too much problem and and Alex whats all the differences that remain  between the the way that you have to look at your investments in emerging markets and  the the the passions that we are seeing now  in the rest of the world yeah I think one of the key things that that you know that the structures in the my Marcus is more than I should have some what will be seen in developed markets given whatever in early two around that deaths of local debt markets is that really like cars is cool the major problem is when as a balance sheet mismatch  and so countries such as Turkey  Brazil lady hello in the knees yeah we have a very high cost of local decks there is a there is a real issue  when cars has moved aggressively that you have significant write downs of equity value and that can lead to capital raise in which a permanent losses for for the  for for for the equity holders  yet the panel impacts it is much more about the ability of the company to policy through that price in and that comes through to the strength of the brand  and so my experience is if you understand the underlying strength of the brand how willing customers ought to pay off for for good products from from from from good company is  then they tend to do more resilient than than other places operates a much more competitive  competitive areas and finally arena you know its something you do to try to wakeup cool  but people are our allies to it  now Im how do you see things developing over the next twelve months a sandwich investors be  be wary of , yeah I think that brexit semi remains a unknown unknown so I think that will be more currency volatility going forward that something Ill have to deal with  and and one thing again that the the weve learned from our emerging market colleagues is that if you do have companies with with divers currency exposure is  that arent exposed to stunning if if sterlings a small part of the business and maybe we should pay a bit more for that stability so I think some of the big global consumer staples companies listed in the U. K.  such as Unilever Diageo  British American tobacco Im in a maybe they should trade at a bit of a premium to denote knowledge the fact that they all global and resilient and and not really going to be buffeted about to much less than a changing world changing investment will arena attics thank you both very much in the , this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for information purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity to which it is sent it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest for other important legal notices please see our website or the fidelity sound cloud or iTunes apps "
1,2,"this podcast is for investment professionals only , markets have shown their teeth so what better time to give the corporate world a full health check whatever the past few weeks over a hundred and sixtieth fidelitys analysts from across the globe Ive done just facts for this use analysts serving its S. snapshots and their assessment of the companies and sex is the cover will fail over the coming twelve months joined in the studio by three these expect thank yous about consume industries credit expense one of the trimming in equities on us for industrials and also Stossel equity analyst with expertise in I. T. welcome to you all , now weve collected reams of data provided by you and your call eggs from which are pretty optimistic pictures emerge for the next year or so which in itself seems a little bit surprising considering the sword of Damocles of a market upset with hang a right has four of twenty seventeen at this year has had plenty of upsets and uncertainties already Im why the optimism I myself can I start with you sure I think what were seeing in tech in particular is optimized its optimism around to digitize ation and what that means in simple terms is turning something physical into something digital numbers bay so that could be digital marketing the shift from traditional marketing to Facebook Google they could be digital design unit to shift from pen and paper to three D. mock ups the shift to digital manufacturing and  I or T. and collecting sense today ten base he just moving from the  the Old World of two eighty two then you all have kind of three D. has  has respect a lot of kind of spending and and  spending intentions going forward in the cool hang outs in the west coast of America will have you know what about it gritty industrials on yeah well its its its quite amazing how far the worlds come since maybe two years ago the beginning of twenty sixteen  we were very worried about the outlook for China  we were thinking that the likes of playing court glow might be might be  and about to go bankrupt  on no one was really investing in and and these very importance  markets of mining and also or the gas  ever since then we have climbed the wall of worry and so the  the corporates the oil majors the mining mages I now flush with cash flow ,  and all looking around the edges to deploy more that cash flow into capsule Quitman spoken to minutes but basically thats the mood of optimism marks your companies as well yeah I think I think this is the first time in many is that weve seen a synchronous global growth  and its been a volatile few years full capsule goods equipment markets a number of very depressed and without favorable outlook for global GDP growth I think well see more investments in caps equipment of the next yes okay kids are coming to you know you radiate to an error of sunny optimism yourself what the companies that you  you cover no I think from a from a spending and and looking ahead perspective most of them are pretty optimistic right now its not to say that there arent some some issues for example were seeing a lot of volume decline in the consumer staples companies but  particularly in developed markets but if you look around the world you see  rising  GDP per capita in a lot of the developing world which is translating in to increased consumer spending in many of these countries on youre seeing people also trading off as they get higher and higher on the wealth and disease and generally speaking you see a lot of opportunities for for many companies to  to to grow there theres els and grow their their presence the world to the middle classes in these countries are becoming a reality yeah and I would say in the developed world you also have the positive side of as wage growth continues to take up an unemployment continues to remain low consumer confidence is real to flee ha you still have this retain spending on in this developed part of the world that that  weve seen for a for a little while now okay well lets lets come to the point on of a race with look at ten at balancing says any good analyst which and dump some of the detail is emerging this for Im a says that for the first time in five years the expectations for capital expenditure are increasing over the next twelve months in all sexes and all region safe what are they planning to spend that cash on one of them if I think again about the natural resources company yes  we have gone through somewhat of a complex holiday for the last two three four yes  on the problem with us as long as that well keeps on growing as long as population keeps on growing an energy material to mom keeps on growing those topics holidays and stable so I think the outlook for both oil and gas expenditure Cup expend capital expenditure on mining cups expenditure  is very favorable as we need to replenish capacity and then oil producing for olds full or the next couple mine  Ole even replacing the trucks that we need to drive around nine or mine another strong reading  sent me something which is let time is that only one in five of the on this that we surveyed think that its the levels of leverage again to increase over the coming years six what my size , I think for a number of  more non cyclical sectors thats because leverage is already at relatively full level and therefore over time we cant really see them going much higher given example so at the minute coca Cola which is double a rated has grossed at to even thaw of over four times its very difficult to see how they can sustain that kind level on and maintain their ratings  AB InBev which has been I just threw a massive acquisition cycle has grossed at TV dot of over five times Molson Coors also big acquisition similar types of love these are not levels that we would have historically considered even in the investment grade range and yet these companies are maintaining not just investment grade but very strong investment grade ratings despite this level so extraordinary I mean I have sentiment is that , well I dont think its that sustainable I think were going to have  the rating agencies are going to have a challenge the next time we see a downturn they did last elicits remember yes they are but these are more stable companies it will be less cyclical than perhaps some of the other names out there so you know for for some of them they may be able to manage the cycle appropriately its a question of when the cycle turns what I thought was most interesting from the survey is thats the two sectors which show the the  stockist oclock decline in average over the next twelve months is the energy material sects not sure no surprise given the increasing quality prices weve seen of the last two years but also the capsule discipline that those sectors and I think that feeds very nicely into the other funding of this report which is the US , those companies who will be swimming in free cash flow over the next two years will show an increasing propensity to to begin to spend again on the cycle of caps with when an energy on materials is just about stopped again muscle coming to you Im I mean youll youll companies  so you flush with cash that they  keeping old off shore and hidden under various mattresses around the world to me what what whats whats likely to happen to how they going to  increases spending for tool yeah I mean I think the primary impact ticket in US is that Republican tax cuts that weve seen particularly the  announces for repatriation of official  funds as well as this in action of the tax rates both of those together means that particularly large tech companies such as apple Google Amazon these types have larger than ever and now balances that can actually be deployed within the US and you know part of that will be on bye bye send dividends but each day you know in the true spirit of what the law was meant to do it its not all going to go back in that way and some of it is going to come back and that the two could you see its way in  into efficiency cap ex Gator Im of my U. S. staples companies I would say theyre seeing something very similar in that they are expecting to  to get large amounts of offer cash back on shore and I suspect that most of that will go towards shareholders I think for the stables companies its a little bit more difficult to deploy that capital towards cap backs because its not clear what they would be spending it on where I think it will go instead of from an investment point of view is more to and then a rather than to capital investment thats interesting and what types of them in a I mean everybodys buying everybody else are spinning off everything its its its been the story of the last few but effectively you have a situation with  private equity company called three G. really transforming the way that we think about staples companies and  most of them are now so focused on costs and arent there margin potential on that they have been sacrificing growth over the past few years and the only way they can continue to show any level of growth is to do an essay as the companies themselves get bigger the top  gets necessarily have to get bigger as well so you see the smaller companies are always talking about more bold Hahnemann I on the larger companies well talk about the leveraging from their last emanate before doing something else thats big but you see the entire gamut of of acquisitions that are going to be made in this in this market  so I mean IT companies when theyre ramping up there in cap access usually because they see a need for is amongst  on second so its a pretty good in Catherine this of whats what else is going on it is I mean if its good if you look at the hype scale van days such as you know Google Microsoft Amazon for them to run out of capacity you know would mean businesses not being able to conduct their business anymore so thats unavoidable so they need to look at two three four years and despite the mind in order to kind of plan for that data centre robots  so yeah I would say then were running a cap ex is definitely bullish sign for their I dont also becoming yet but youre saying for the up to the next full yeah definitely and you know if its specially running out data centers in regions where you havent had before that could easily take a year or two to kind of get up to speed willfully affects date sent okay well Im all of us listen to inflation I am too thirds of the in the survey a sink high input costs thats up from Hough last year  so a good indication of late cycle perhaps and wages also  set to rise especially  in China is this the beginning of firm of reflection , well I think sets in the there is increasing pressure on the cost base of industrial companies  you can see thats if you look at the oil price the steel price  culpa plots them whatever whatever metal is which goes into the capsule and show goods we are seeing inflation  and we will see that eventually pass through to the consumer regarding wage inflation yes unemployment remains remains very lover arounds  the developed worlds on way beginning see inflation in wages particularly in places like Germany wed  union negotiations are becoming tough on pushing for pushing full wage increases more strongly you too can I can I come to you because are you okay if if this does begin to take hold I am a youll companies going to absorb that because on the margins of say a depressant and Im sure theyre gonna have to pass it on , so I think you have to split  a lot of the consumer goods world into two  parts one is the guys who actually produce food beverage staples those kinds of things and the second group are the retailers who have to sell those on I think what we are finding it increasingly is that these tables companies are still getting through their price inflation but perhaps clothing company where demand is structurally  lower are not getting through quite so much of their inflation and the retailers are certainly struggling  especially in in a certain develop markets for competition in retail remains very high both from on a brick and mortar competitors and from online competitors on those retailers are really struggling to pass on a price increase his tooth to customers so I think we are seeing the same tensions its just in a slightly different  place and the question is whether it passes through  to to some of the guys who havent experienced it so far yes you know in the in the tech world were seeing set the input prices going up the ram prices spiking , pretty much across the board well we also seeing is cost inflation wage inflation should I say rising materially too you know a lot of it comes through in the four stop based comp established compensation but even just basic wages particularly to back up what all of us said in Germany all rising not just for eating the top Broxtowe I. T. expects but even all the way down to university graduates  I definitely seeing which in fact twenty can write well thanks to all for sharing your insights from the sixties you cover on a remarkably upbeat report is about all of it from him and also start so Im thank you to you for listening the full survey which is headlined as good as it gets with lots more analysis is available at the Tennessee institutional dot com for professional investors of course from all of us at fidelity international that goodbye , this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by per investors this podcast is provided for information purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity to which it is sent it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest for other important legal notices please see our website or the fidelity sound cloud or iTunes apps "
2,3,"this podcast is for investment professionals only , in early March can China a giant stays and chemicals company one of the largest industrial street in China offered a jumbo size bond issuance with over six billion dollars the largest corporate bond sales on Asian is he was so far this year that was a sentimental Ising investment or risk to be avoided on the surface at least can Chinas environmental social and governance tools are enough to put the fear of god into even a hardened investor the company handles millions of tons of toxic discharge every employs a hundred and sixty thousand stuff to make and handle those chemicals and has to navigate tight regulation in a number of territories not be its tough enough to put you off well with me today to explain why they want to discourage by that list any of dangerous and to help us understand a bit better about how ESG considerations really work in the investment coal face are here in London might turn into a re to research on the line from saying I often Chang credit analyst and in Hong Kong Brian Collins fixed income portfolio manager welcome to you all but Bryan Ill start with you if you were the person who ultimately made the decision to incorporate the can China essence annual poll failure Im I mean broadly hes ESG even a possible consideration Im in China its not something that leaps to write the forefront of my mind but thats thats perhaps make amends you will EST is a still a relatively new concept for a lot of issue is and investors for that matter actually in this part of the world but its its interest and I suppose the  insuring that is its a factor for for a lot of investors is is increasing rapidly in issue is a responding to it I mean you write to some extent that for this two can issue a can China you dont immediately think about this is that ESG champion but its one way by the concept of the SG investing in China is actually starting to become much much more relevant you know we saying a significant investment from these authorities not just Chinese but Indian and other regional powers in environmental remediation so that could be  relating to  renewable energy it could be environmental remediation for water treatment for example and so were seeing a lot more investment opportunities come up in that space a lot of companies in this part of the world will have a strong level of government ownership particularly in China so the state owned enterprises and often theyre going to not only be providing the service that they are they going to employing a lot of people said there is an element of the service that they have to the country to keep people employed so this very much that aspect and then from the governments perspective we talking about government owned organizations and were talking about those whereby leverage is hi the   in focus at the moment Sydney excessive leverage and clearly companies have to be doing something if there government owned that are in the national interest so these themes a strong they getting stronger and thats relevant here can Chinas case to some extent the more broadly we gonna see a lot more of it in the years to come so very relevant Im across the board in China  Alvin its come to you in Shanghai youre the expert youve been following can China for Im a wireless  as an analyst how does ESG play in to a company like this Brian described it you know its  its  it stay tuned and its huge so its its becoming a much more life issues arise thank you yes she is relatively new in you in China there think company especially SO we theyre playing a leading role in ensuring they are doing good on the S. T. especially and also yes you will impact their business operations as well so if you have noticed that the reasons kind of talks from the top China top political leaders have been placing more and more focus on environmental issues in China so the company as big as can China if the valve Molly some kind of vitamins emissions ten dot its highly likely that operation will be suspended by governments for that excessive mission so they have to make sure to invite mental social and the government in this issue up to standard requirement assessing so I think thats also related to do the ultimate find the return of the company and the fumble for performance of the company phone as well and how do you engage with Ken China  on on these topics the interest thing is actually can China is one of the first batch of company they kind of for continue to release a sustainable report on the website so they continue to have the report as early as twenty eleven and now they have like each year they would have seen the report detail along with that kind of I first on east all all the difference a part of the S. and cheap and also we will also do some  background check on help company whether they have kind of fun some scandalous on governments yeah so thats probably the things I do own can China when checking yes yes I am is it becoming Im more of a life issue for you is it some is is it becoming a more important factor when you were considering companies its always been a part of the research walk as a mention because the environment issues association a couple is issue can affect the operating results but I do have the feeling that the domestic  especially from the bureau but theyre getting more and more kind of requirements on specific yes the requirement on these companies so we are intentionally picking what he more attention to the S. T. S. back on these companies so instead of I am being driven by the investment performance aspect which is what you you talk to banks Im originally that theres a more explicit requirements that youve youve perhaps go to lay at various things at the request of investors yes I yes this can China is being on something of a a buying spree  perhaps white needs to to raise this  this cash in sport companies like Pirelli the Italian time make your export a sim Genta an actor chemicals company also here with in London is Mike Doullens arch of research I am a U. you met the company when it was on the London leg of its road shows   trying to drum up interest in the in the essence what with the discussions like when you talk to them yeah thats correct Sir they Richard in Asia first it will then they came to to Europe and the US and I met them while they were in London they were issuing bonds and dollars in your eyes so there was a wide investor appeal hence they did the the global road show you know my ankle I guess is that I followed Syngenta a full a number of years  Syngenta itself will be issuing bones later this year so I wanted to get a better understanding of how can China was gonna look off to the Syngenta business hours going to integrate this engine to business and ultimately how it was gonna finances into business when it comes to the market later this year yes you can bring it back to that how did that plan did they did they present  and the SG aspects  to the  to the company when they when they came to talk to you they didnt formally present in a steep but as Alvins already alluded to yes she is embedded in our research process here fidelity and has been for a long time weve always focused on governance where its appropriate we focus on him for environmental angle and the social angle as well and now it just seems to be you know its under this this new  invoke rapper ESG but weve always focused on that and its embedded in a process you know I think Syngenta is a good acquisition for chem China from ESG perspective you know China has twenty percent of the worlds population but only around eight percent of the worlds arable lands it has a huge chaw engine feeding is people said as a social angle there and is also an environmental angle and sentience is a suite of acrid chemical seats and  and crop science will definitely help them in that process and so it sort of wraps the whole all three of them how sweet , about a base of you Alvin as well you you you gather this information and then Im the processes that you  presented back to  the team here it at fidelity so  to twenty three thats because it wasnt just I am  Brian Collins hes  of course in Hong Kong but other PMs before he manages  here in London as well , yeah I mean as as as you know as I say we  you know we we we we do a credit work we present that back to the team but yes is part of that credit work simple Freddie manages a more focused on that than others  but its its definitely a very important part of our process so what are the sorts of questions that youre feeling around this in a war what is it what is its governments like water this water the social angles  is it doing damage to the environment  those kinds of questions Alvin do your part of this process as well what are some of the questions that you get from PM still just Brian of course in  Im calling but  therapy if any images dotted around the world what are the questions that firing at you around about the company like in China I think the general questions as Michael has also kind of for describing is actually how the company does on the SP and then actually the things actually I do is actually I was trying to come okay as in as much as information I can from the company on the on the on the on the on separate EDS and GM to do some research on how how things are kind of for managed by can China  I think apart from the company a data the company also is actually or some kind of independent research on how companies doing against its peers like Im Bloomberg theres actually a pecan pie compress and how how much a mission  all kinds of  units revenue is full time time and how do they compare to the PS and actually when I checked that Kenshin actually did a little bit better and compared to the global chemical P. is so I can I can come back to him saying that on the admission side of companies actually doing a little bit better than PS so I think its a public image kind of he Ill give him up over HP school so thats an example how we communicate was a PM on different aspects of the S. E. N. G. and how much do you have to borrow down how much  engagement you have to have with the company I am to you on to some of the more probing questions from from peons I think for for all these Chinese company  yes she was also quite kind of new for them so its quite unusual I mean I mean for them to get company come crashing on ESP you cant you cant imagine that a company will only give you good information on USG perfect yes in the G. is up to all analysts kind of responsibility to discover is there anything I mean you realize in times of yes you know what what the more interesting things that you manage to find us one of the interesting I find out exactly the company has Michael said that the date  ten time is also one of the big might cause of tires in China and they think of tires is kind of tied into the fuel consumption by car so I and then actually the Hopkins improving the technology in ties to kind of try to improve efficiency view and thats come in directly improved like that too is reduce the fuel consumption help to relieve the environment so I think yeah so the thing they were kind of small parts of the company that actually it doing something good to the violence so thats the reason for the reason that actually we   we join the recommended  can China as kind of  yes he complied Brian Im coming to you is one of the the PMs making a a judgment call on whether to put money in or not how did you reach youll youll conclusion  Iran can China because of the jumbo deal nature it means that the  initial pricing for this particular deal was going to be attractive and this is also one which had been worked  said extending communicated with the investor base and we had met them in here in nature and in in London as mentioned before so there was a a time line here where we can actually put together I wrote is and actually get an excellent allocation in what otherwise its going to be an attractively priced investment grade Chinese state owned enterprise so the plus the fact that we had multiple points along the curve multiple dollar bonds a year a bond as well meant that it was a wide widely appealing thats really what drove it for me to put into a couple of different portfolios the fact that we had fundamentally a high quality Chinese SO we making a large scale high profile overseas acquisition with all the benefits that we talked about in terms of bringing that technology at home to China and also allowing China to move up the value chain so this is a strategically important series of X. decisions for camp China and so from a fundamental perspective we have a very strong foundation the valuations would clearly cheap  in terms of being out to get the kind of spreads that were on offer for what hes a  so low I in a mid to high triple be kind of credit very solid were not talking about something thats high yield here so if you can get it hi one hundred sort of low two hundred kind of spread across multiple points along the curb this is extremely attractive from an investment grade hopefully managers perspective the biggest sort of draw back in the near term is really with the technical factors because its such a big deal across multiple crunches it needs to be priced and it could mean that  such a big deal trades week on the bright and so we do need to be sensitive about sort of these more tech technical aspects of how the book was built and the book build and all the other indications that the trading team provided back to all of us was extremely strong and gave us a lot of confidence as well as part of that process the is the fact is over here are important we want to make sure that which direction is this company heading towards it looking to make incremental improvements in these factors or is it going the other way and clearly we dont want to be having these sorts of fact is risk investment profile going forward so knowing that theyve been looked at that the analysts and Alvin have done some digging and that we know that there are some in general improvements on that front just for the supports the investment case Brian how important is it that Im we doing this research  I cells that people Alvin and Mike  are asking these tough questions its important in a couple of different ways  one is that you know we as a family certainly use some of external provide is such as  as mentioned by Alvin early  to look at information about on Bloomberg or to use other external providers like sustain a latex however the coverage there is hes not completes this certainly large parts of the investment universe that we look at a spa see when you come into EM and especially when you come into some of the parts of Asia like China and like Kim China with simply you dont have these third party assessment about ESG or theres no third party school so for all intensive purposes we got it we got it bring that into our research as we always have as part of that assessment the great thing about having these external provide is is that it provides an external benchmark it helps you get there faster but we want to make sure that we we bring that in purely because thats our value add thats a value add as bottom up fundamental research is is that if we can bring it in when theres no other external source of the SG assessments the other thing thats important here in this is a bit longer term its something that as a then with done for quite some time but I think were going to have to do more of it and thats really about engagement so if if for example when were having these conversations with companies like Kim China like others and were asking the more more about these Ian E. S. and G. dynamics , we can actually stop to hope at through engagements actually affecting some possible improvements incremental perhaps but none the less if were asking these questions if were trying to see what management and doing to improve on these various metrics then that ultimately can also be a positive just through the sheer active engagement  as active investors  Alvin your noting in CZS sticky yeah so just what time as Brian brightly put out and I think the coverage for the young company specially to companies in China from next reports on yes she is very limited so as a result actually was talking to developers to separate project to focus on a scoring system please come yes G. copy like you like can China  in China the crunch to mom for yes cheap score probably is limited but we can see a growing demand for that kind of fun comments so actually we are dividing sort of like a a kind of a question based on kind of crash in sheet for companies country we are trying to score  Ill company on the separate school sheet and thats cool should be different from the XO seven provide us like Bloomberg insisting latex and we hope that score based on law firm in the research we will be more reliable the more kind small just more just to kind of reflection of the how come actually did on yes G. a structured approach to help build that picture yes exactly just one final point for me really Brians comments around changing behavior is crucial I think you know with fidelity we will we focus on that from the governments perspective we always look to you to get companies to behave better from the governments perspective why cant we do that on the environmental side on the social side as well can we I think we can you know I dont think weve met with investor this year that hasnt wanted to discuss yes GM what were doing on the SG and how important it is to use to our process absolutely grace okay woke Mike Dirnt art to research thank you very much in Shanghai thanks to of insuring a credit analyst and in Hong Kong to you Brian Collins financial under today can I have your with this for that he put cost thanks very much indeed for listening to my , this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for information purposes only and intended only for the person or entity to which it is sent it must not be reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest for other important eagle notices please see our website or the fidelity sound cloud or iTunes apps "
3,4,"hello Im Richard again this part cost is for investments professionals only why should I reconsider my application to Asia thats the question the Tennessee on sis in this podcast we explore the very latest in the investment world in Asian challenge some received wisdom and find out whos putting money away in the region might not be what you like Im joined here in our home comes to get by to investment iritis and experts on the reason for this from fixed income and Terry Moran who covers expertise welcome to you both , now were recording this just off to the announcement of which Chinese mainland listed stocks to being to did in the M. S. C. I. flagship emerging markets index as a benchmark for over a trillion and a half dollars worth of assets Gary is this a game changer for the region as well as for China it is in that Chinese main land shows can no longer be ignored  I think its fair to say that if we if we consider where investors have been putting that money in the lost well for the last ten years or even longer than that been very easy to ignore the mainland and because its not in the index suddenly they may even see index and you can no longer ignore it sign in that sense definitely it is a game changer , Madusa means full for asset manufacturers even like the likes of fidelity is that if you havent already been looking H. as you can have to stop doing that and its not an easy task and the companies may generate a report in Mandarin  the the company ripples will be written in Mandarin as well so you you need to get your analysts in place to in order to do that and this is not an easy task well Im sure youve been brushing up your right  in Gary but nobodys annoying fast hes one of the greatest hurdles to investing in in China is that the companies are of course reporting in the rain native tongue so youve got to be able to most that have had how do we cope with it and quite simply theres no such having people on the ground  so we can analysts here in in Hong Kong Singapore  Shanghais well he he speak the language and go meet the companys face to face Im not leak Im in the fixed income well he must be fed up with the attention that your expertise colleagues  okay I think  with all this and I see I a siren that excitement but Im is there a halo effect of raising the profile of investing in the region and all asset classes as a result of all of this well which Im actually not we have a we saw a little revolution going on actually a few weeks ago  de um Berg boxes index announced that they also going to include China on showing that one index to this is causing it in the real revolution in our bond market you as Gerry mentioned this is the extracting more attention to what the on shore market in China and the inclusion is going to need a lot of the benchmark for the world which is a large amount to offer institutional movie director to be more attention to all dogs one walk so we are talking about five percent in the server Bloomberg RKC necks are percent for China on shore its not very large issue compare this to the size of the child in trouble mock act which is about twelve treating you as doc its its a drop but its a beginning and an optimist add to that what what weve seen in the last twelve months is equities have done a very good marketing job in terms of talking about MCI including H. as and when we got me client says the questions are always directed towards the equity Weldon it seems to me that a soft and civic no like north but not well nine that is happening in in the fixed income space as well Anna and not something which I think is quite important because its not just Chrissy money coming into the main and but the fixed income money as well which is probably on on on the whole the big award of catch how all of the clients changing who is putting money into into China that is is not changing , look on the fixing go besides if you look at the bond markets the the main player all steel the in the institutional money if you look at the overall China on trouble mock at , overall we have a box less than two percent offering on the ship and if you look the composition of this ownership is mostly institutional clients like central bank so run will fund the retail invest all shoot complicate their all the message hasnt reached that far yet or is it confidence a lack of confidence its simply a diferentes each of the development of the markets he would typically see first the institutional going when you going down they have more resources to generalize the mark at and for that speed returning best off yes its exactly the same ready for the equity space in that the key that unlocks the H. a market for for investors to stop connect and that is really something the institutions can can use  and its not that easy for the return of the retail going to do that and they say they invest in companies like ourselves Im thinking about the questions that these clients institutional clients are asking you both how have they changed over the past couple of years much more receptive I think to to Asias them before is very easy to to ignore because there was never in the benchmark  so you could pretty much say  you know I read we dont night of companies very well this corporate governance issues in that then you can just ignore the entire market but I forget the the market itself if you look at Shanghai and shin Jen the the go to market cap of about seven and a half trillion can that to Tokyo which is six point eight trillion cases the main ends that you big market in Japan  signal so you consegue over it that the people well because because of the point of that would have been  in the index we see it  similar development on the fixed income side of being in Asia for the past seven years and what we say is that we are entering the the salt fees the first phase was going to be your all meeting some international invest all and the question was why why would I put my money in Asia I specifically in China a few years after that the question was actually and you can give me a positive argument for me to invest in in in the shower in China because they wont search to convince also in there  investment bought to start putting money in China and in Asia and now we are entering the substation the so stages how how do I do that we carry let some took a little bit more detail at at the embassy eyes about to push huge companies some still unknown Abril with onto the world stage what impact is that going to have on their business well first of all you you should see more so that say foreign institutional investors on the on the shareholder register which you know I can bring some more questions so I you you tend to get maybe a little bit more activist type investors and particularly great to focus and its G. which is you know is a key theme at the moment and something thats management teams perhaps until now have not had to concern themselves with perhaps not so much I mean it is a growing thing globally anyway so a service is it shouldnt come as a surprise to any company but  as you get more international vest is on you know as I said on the show to register do expect to see a lot more focus on ASG corporate governance  and and and general question around the you know this was going on with the business in the direction is heading I wish we got to do with the money that this investment represents well hi fi the good companies will get  so the great to a great sense of the cash that comes in particularly we think is awesome as a active manager we can choose the businesses that we that we invested so hopefully the passive companies get more more cash we should condemn reinvest in the business hi fi growth rates of return one of the the comment that the high frequency here from international invest all when I tell them Hey look at this market is growing so fast I often hear well that means that the company are just piling up more deaths so is actually from a research point of view this is not a good thing its actually not really the case its also has to do with the stage of evolution of this company most of the company in Asia and particularly in China Ive been extremely reliant on the banking system so we do using loans to finance their working capital or the expansion now if you see  if you continue evolving becoming more sophisticated you need a large amount of capital which bank cannot provide you should you need to go on the crypto market your the thing is that the more sophisticated to be calm the more divers you wont use sources of funding to be so thats also motivation for this company to come into the Asian you is almost more market  international markets so its not necessarily the same company his ring more that is three more company and we see that every once you have made in the U. sure a new name coming on the market it requires a lot of  research power but at the same time thats significantly increasing the diversification potential you know space save it for thinking about the they say it away from the the very make a cap companies in the Asian market do you see them starting to use fixed income markets because Im assuming a lot of the smaller companies the reading have much experience that he  are we seeing that happen more more do you think the challenge that this company I have at the moment is two fold firstly for small company they tend to be higher risk more on the high yield space ends in China all showed their results yet hi you market most of the high your company that you would find are actually full an intra thats the first thing the second thing is that at the moment if you see these little name trying to issue on the US to all bond market they would have to pay your death would be so high just you make  make the offer flexible that it would not make sense for them ms with it it is going to take time for the small guys to come in this market are you mention active management but I wonder whether the inclusion in an index  heralds the decline of of active in China because  now come  investors can pop the cash and the funds that  the tracks that index get the exposure get the diversification for example  fit that China office  but  they can do it very cheaply first of all the what you have to remember the inclusion at the moment is it well they could five percent inclusion right so effectively that they capping the size of the Chinese stocks twenty five percent of the tree size and is only two hundred thirty four the moving into the into after several thousand theres about four to about forty four and a half thousand listed companies I mean three for a big chunk of those are ready to be on investable fool investors like a self because of  servlet quiddity constraints and such but but there is a lot of companies which are not in the index for start say active managers can beyond the the boundaries of the index which it creates alpha hopefully the if you get youll still cool right , this is actually another question that I frequently get these why  the views active management to invest in markets like China on show and Im very open about city the use of Pfaff passive investment in certain markets hi need develop efficient market again makes a lot of sense especially as it complements genetic strategy now if you Katz D. specifically a channel on trouble market one of the big challenge there east you properly assess the credit risk of you sure do you know that Im showing the having different reading system the local rating agency only used three E. ratings the triple a double a single a and I think TV its only have led to the recent trend where you see a differentiation in the credit spreads off the front  reading group so the the challenge if your internationally in the store and you try to folders rating is that you especially if you buy CV you just going to invest randomly and you dont know which ought to credit dog we are going to use it what does the spread of which is going to widen and the one that theyre going to tighten so what if hes really a market for active management makes a lot of sense Im much less diverse vacation in terms of the official rating but your point is that the reason Ive S. vacation  in the reality of how how companies a the menace of the wrist they represent absolutely it is normal markets with the reading torrentz necessarily reflect this reality if youre investing with active management you can you can choose the company management you believe all working on your behalf as a shareholder so then forget it if you are investing in past taking China where theres a great deal of SO please you youre embracing certain risks that maybe you dont youre not aware of  particularly if if a large chunk of your passive market is a state enterprise you are are investing in companies where you dont really have a say in whats going on and then on the management is generally say government driven somewhat and that they can be called upon to do national service and sometimes that leads to poor caps are location another whats the the company is being  also told to behave in a way that suits the country rather than shelled eggs exactly so I I could be a statesman bank and Luke may be coming up with the best new idea weve ever seen that you happen to be at an industry that employs two million people I and the government may say to me weve got five hundred million dollars youve got to give it to Richard because  they they keeping to hunt two million people employed where is really even thinking from a shareholder perspective and future growth I should be given that money to the and then he can incredible returns in and thats the the industry the future site so without really realizing it sometimes in passive you are youll youll put putting money to you two companies way like I said you dont have the grace is controlled and they can be some missile cation capsule what about the governance in  in normal companies that to the have a normal structure   old one that with more familiar with perhaps in the state and enterprises Im what about its the  it managements priorities that really is not different towards the right a the element that is yet to happen in in some of those companies so the one thing when people talk about China and assist as you tree for Asia shes not just to the China story and people say oh corporate governance is is full I think that you have to think about what we mean by that at she quite often put sixty when you meeting companies that are not the make A. caps youve already got experience and the the company will be offering me George he by the founder and a couple of his friends that say and theyve never really had to do was shareholders before so its not that the cowboys and they they you know they can run off of your money in a in a frozen accounting thats not true its old its just that they havent had to deal with the the the expectations of shareholders and and that can be seen thats not bad corporate go this is just an experience corporate governance so how do we engage them with with companies like that its  that says a large positive what fidelity  investment professionals talk about aids  exciting so what are the conversations like theres no other substitute to have any faith in the ground and until can come to talk to them  whether thats through the analysts and the pool for a management team or quite often for equity capital markets team who who whose role is to , whos roadies corporate engagement to discuss some of the things that we that we hold dear she was a if you like from  our investment perspective and and discuss things we will vote on and and talk about these issues thats a very important point and its something that sometimes me serve interpret outside of Asia is if the Cutie if you look at large and small Asian companies the ownership beach you should be more concentrated so it is usual to have the phone though was the chairman was the issue there is nothing we on the bodice but to some extent it also explain the explosion of the the bond markets in the in Asia if you look at  back in two thousand and ten Wendy E. the bank European banks thought thats pulling Asia we saw a lot of the seizure of coming on the market the fifth UT heights to change them in thirty two show more to treat you sure to invest all you she sure bond and you want to get it free to you need to disclose quite a few information like when you the staff at the company and  decides we help also to improve the governance of the company that that that that we cover so these are still emerging  this is some focus with the some way to get bill but a lot of fun US involvement is already happened yeah I would just be careful with that  and managing because  its slight the at the front of the kibbutz one of the thing that I usually struggle with with so it was in the store that are not necessary for me now we see the Asian space is Asia I get put in the same bracket as emerging market , and  Elise also people to say all Asian I saw expense you look at the last time the gets much better yield much better every time youre not comparing apples apple did you really T. when you invest Im going to focus on that the fixed income side do we need to use when you invest in Asia you invest in about sixteen different markets and some of them are very good about it some of them are highly developed if you look at countries like Catholic home called like Singapore they have they are very high level of development if you look at the the GDP per capita out of Singapore is actually higher than the GDP of computer from from Germany so we see my point is that it its a levy its dangerous to talk about emerging because we are talking of a good mix between developed and emerging you make a really interesting point because people are beginning to shift from emerging market debt to Asia for precisely the sort of reason that you you change the rest a file on it there is a diverse vacation away from other debt markets but you all lettering the risk perhaps   that goes along side that I dont know if we are lowering the risk at I think that there is more awareness full what is jobs to for up to recent the when people were looking at the shot they were mostly looking at the year that you can get  this cheese for yet and if the TV if you look at the the the the investment you can make in the bond market in Asia you would get a much higher a year and then you get in Europe but you would get sixty million that you get seen in in the US but for lower duration , its a very attractive proposition just seen them off a risk profile done people so start looking at the difference it toward the can invest in sure we talking about see if you focus on the Asian used our bond market its  its a market that has grown by about twenty percent on annual basis every year over the pasta a yes and this is that also true the emergence of new sectors a few years ago if you wanted you bet on the consumption of gaming you will have one two names now your rubber real sex talk to what people are saying is its not a about healed is about diversifying double for you in two different industries and the types of outcomes that people are looking for  has moved on as well carry  eight days reason just about grace  nominated theyre all all the faxes the that we seize being quite interesting within the region for example dividend right and it often shocks people to to think of Asias a dividend market but if you do if you look in markets like Thailand where the yield Carneys around two point seven percent Taiwan where about three and a half percent you know weve weve got markets in this league so the set is diversification weve weve got markets the offer different things for different types of investors and and and actually some of the same to me yesterday that they would they theyd read a study that one of the key drivers Fisher price of return and check price cap to growth is is an increase in dividend within the Asian region Im sustaining you that there are other factors of than growth but of course to grow your dividends you you generally have to grow youll in a grow your business and grow and grow your cash flow  so that a series links but but there are other factors we we we find quite interesting , when investors put the money into a in fixed income what exactly is it that  that that by one point up to touch is this a good makes a good balance between developed markets and emerging market thats aka couldnt stressing of these these point , on the side yes what DO so buying is , diversification lower coronation was on the market we started talking about the China entre one market again a lot of people are looking at this market because it offers like the higher yield than than other markets but from my point to here what is the main benefits especially in the markets where a lot of people talk about stress valuation are scared about what a T. T. , what channel control is providing you with is an asset class which is close to zero correlation with all their assets since , so you tell me what is bothering you put for you in some of the Pacific Ocean so I think this is this is really wants institutional investor or more and more looking for the group beyond the yield and  cuts the diversification for control and I think apart from that it it on the whole a bigger picture Thai food few buying Asia in particular the equity market is you find future there is do I think about that is the new business is a developing in the region which dont exist anywhere else in in the world ten cent is a great example by the this is a a platform it with three that we chat platform has multiple for a function the the time really exist in the west in western companies looking to say well which we could do that  so we we you are in your investing in the future your best in the future growth as well so you just throw some status  you know weve got four point five billion people in the region which is about sixty percent of the global population , thirty five percent of the global GDP yeah that is growing faster than most places in the world so you looking at places like Indonesia five percent plus a G. P. growth China six six and a half percent NDS around seven percent growth so that that thirty five percent of GDP should grow over time if if we continue to see the the current trajectory which we dont use we dont think that was the main reason search engine and your second line we do expect  you know GDP to continue growing at the rate so weve been seeing someone yet at the same point in time Asia ex Japan is only four and a half percent of the global equity index is an enormous mismatch on its the same in  and fixed income as well that the  the proportions of that allocated to Asia Im on a much smaller than they they will be on that time on that measure the bellhops reasons for that though  wait wait we coming to the end  so Im off to an inspiring discussion apps on the the the good reasons for out for investing they just what all the things that investors need to watch out for that one to the potential downsides  because you conscious plateau in the traditional risk that these  scene in markets like and like you John is the value of what IT this is typically what people would tell you is in that   the off  uncertainty youre going to see much higher but I TT on emerging market including Asia , its actually not being the easy for you guys  I go back to you to the brakes seats in referendum walls all day trying to election what weve seen actually is that even use the law bond market specially in the investment grade side Id be the safe in , because you all we are able to move shift money engine on barman who is pretty well shelter from the rest of the world and were you opportunity cost are actually not that the that the title its an amazing ten thats K. it is an and alongside the increased volatility I must say that there is there is generally great three tell participation in some some markets which which does sort of create more Chun and so therefore you can you can be on the wrong side of that so that there is an element of the  but  so one of the things we should mention that it is a lot of state owned enterprises in in the region in our big chunk of the market and if you are a passive investor in particular you you are taking on the state owned enterprise risk which is he doesnt always know whats happening with the caps of this that the company has say so there are elements of risk that you have to be aware of Im so that full and thats the point of why active fast the blasts the key on the keys to the same place right in the region is you trying to avoid those areas  particularly not less so hes about us that one will say that but  there is there is a risk of caps misapplication so you and lick so were going to youre probably over the next few months if not the is about more the full dean in China this is already making the headlines off all the the most of the the national newspaper , do we have a team the way we seeds from on the ground is its a positive development its a positive the men in the sense that it improves the capital allocation the bad you should Bad Company what putting that were are just , doing him in eighteen and considerate way de Gaulle all going to be section the government is going to ease stepping and say look in the store you need to realize the risk that youre all taking so it is beneficial for boards company because he to help them allocates , capital property if youre a good company should last four hundred and is good for in the store because now when you put your money in the company you know that youre going to be compensated for the risk that youre taking so its a  a more efficient market link that the is maturing and  that brings that brings with it benefits K. M. Im one of the risks to think about as well is that you are taking on institutional risk and and by that I mean that youre still seeing some developments and develop a within Reckitt treme varmints  evening it could even be so the legal fields and in some cases  governments and say Thailand is a great example where we can see some elections the first elections for a number of years next year so I brought those risks as well that youre embracing when you look in the region  but again you just need to be very selective plenty of opportunity but go in with the rising sun the best way to go to some right to  let me thank you bye scarring on him and look foolish  for joining me I hope youve enjoyed listening to this goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals only and should not be relied on by private investors this podcast is provided for information purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity to which it is sent it must not reproduced or circulated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest for other important legal notices please see our website or the fidelity sound cloud or IT apps "
4,5,"hello and welcome to the July edition of rich pickings fidelitys axes allocation for cost Im Richard again editor in chief in today Im in the garden just that site fidelitys chemistries office a small oasis in the city of London and if youre looking freeway sees then youve come to the right place for we have an unadulterated century of thoughts and investment reflection in this months part because as an asset allocation team take stock ahead of the summer break how to reach market sentiment greats in the system I trade rules are rules discuss rich pickings indeed , joining me in the studio all three of the multi asset team festival will come two shot Herrington mark is an honest man so that this month I want to know what is the one thing you wish you had known at twenty one , I think I wish I had known how valuable it would have been too you know a second language beyond English yes and Im which language  I am Chinese and why does it say who will be and is increasingly widely spoken absolutely okay well Im also here is put funny manager bill McCracken  what would you tell you what to the one year old self I I wish I knew in that school and would only appear in the World Cup once or twice more in my life and that the I should enjoy it while it lasts  just to explain were recording this Im very shortly I after Englands disappointing exits from Russia further along in the in the World Cup in the right and welcome back Im ana stupid SCCA global economist Im Ukrainian fan I imagine and youve been away for some months but what hot tip would you give your younger self I think  I wish I had known that the value of time only arises over the years , time becomes really precious and you dont know  that this is the case when youre young , an investment in deeds to it to save it when you have its right well thank you all for being here Im dumb and Ill start with you if I may and the applications this month has anything changed as a group changes positions itll nothing has changed to we had to have a long discussion of how to what we want to do but we decided to add to as the neutral negatives underweight fixed income and always Kash and and it seems that  at right now there is not much appetite to add or in back to take risk off the table  so is headed to keep the complication okay well Im on that theme of risk is  Ive been talking to somebody else about this because I regularly since may of nexus that were missing one of us still whats at the chief investment officer with a multi team James Bateman is traveling this week but I managed to catch up with him a little bit earlier about what he thinks is driving sentiment , welcome to guarantee conferencing system are you going to the conference IT honored by hash the interesting thing at the moment a market is that we know were getting to the some of the volume we know the typically around the old business sentiment can be employed by about that right low volume Im we know a couple of things we know that the dangerous is softening up base case and date softening but motor racing and and its not gonna be a major slowdown we also know that there is a bifurcation between the rest the rest of the world in a day to the US much stronger says about could subject in a in a white you will come with the U. S. the site challenge there is clearly that US is being driven by a by the Fang technology in general  and dot narrowness of markets can be a consent , only when we think about the  the drivers of markets over the coming months at some point the risk of us in the long trump is stepping up its rhetoric on on a trade war and eat stepping up his actions and that will be can be further retirement actions almost on medium term outlook is that this will be a a storm it may be quite a large teacup in the shorter term not really could while markets and and particularly specific sectors areas if it looks like theyre going to be talked to so the base case rusted there is a limited being overweight equities at the moment but a very strong action now for buying on IT see you any actual weakness that comes through  over the the summit here it  and again as I said last month I think thats a reasonable chance that we will move back to  great position and expertise come September over time  she big market had a great debate over the summer Glau , after the time , but that was changed in speaking to me a little bit so Im Im Im a essentially this is a repeat of  something you said a little while ago which was sent in may and go away , well looking at  the micra dated place to  we see that   the fundamentals on notes deteriorating verifies but and not accelerating ida and this has been the case as indicated by a leading indicator  now for a few months  so its its not its not very different we think the data has is probably a finding some floor right now on a global basis  but its hard to to have a very strong conviction either way social youre not particular concern family for the fundamentals seems sort of settled where they are at the moment , I am in the fundamentals of settled weather at the moment I think we had one month of , side ways Im off to several months of decline and and if you Smith that dates are thats I think we do in most of our models and and so on  actually the the direction of travel for grace at the moment is still leva  James did to add that the U. S. stands out as having held up much better than ever else might that becomes a critical question for us going forward is can the US maintain that strength given the rest of what weakness and I think even that was starting to see perhaps some very very ad in in in in how to how to really make a big cold on it but some very the signs that businesses in the US are particularly concerned about trade and there are some some constraints within within the market that will come to trade in a minute but let me bring it in where were you and all this time your right to run here , photos of course are you  way sync and seeing them through the summer for  for how we positioned one seven comes back off with some other things well my my stance at the moment is  on the defensive side in the run  Im a bit more cautious on equities and some of my colleagues  and a bit more rave by stools the the bond market to explain why  I think aina talked about the lead indicators and slowed global growth and that Santley being  important for me  all the developments higher  prices higher interest rates  stronger doll of these are conventionally  a quite challenging at this is for markets and in encourage one to to err on the side of caution Im forty see that changing because you say is getting through the next couple of months hi I think there is a a wrist to to Charles point that the US data deteriorates  and  now been welcome for markets those  so they say this building narrative around tree thats not particularly helpful the the silver lining stately to deterioration in US growth is that we we could see some of those  videos I mentioned a moment ago that are currently at settings are head winds for global growth I move in a friendly fashion so a lower  price low long term interest rates a weaker dollar  could actually set the scene for red for asset prices to to swing up from the end of the summer almost I think also say wait interesting about the last few months is that lost you might catch on to play black teas and think everything looks fine if you drill down a bit deeper and you looked at some of the sectors you seem defensive sectors do much better if you looked at regions youve seen the Hyatt beats at regions before much West Side emerging markets have been particularly punished  and currency well do you see in some of the most on loved and and somewhat at defensive currencies debit except tiki the dollar and and so actually that sort of shift in mindset has played out just paid out in different parts of the market but but I think if you look at the move to the market soon in the round I would contend that the consensus view to de is that weve had a bit of a slowdown but things are stabilizing and that risk appetite remains reasonably healthy in the right in there there are well I sometimes offenses cracks in the ice the problems in imagine markets and to a one or two sectors and and so on but these are viewed as being the exception rather than the rule  to go but your question what would get me more excited about buying risk I actually see the okay become bit more  but more frightened of whats going on  for sentiment to deteriorate and we want you to step in well , can never see with absolute sound to that so you might step but it but I think this a one would have to take that test that possibility much more seriously and in those circumstances you  Anna Im are you seeing the same sort of uncertainty or   are you taking more comfort from  from from the data I think  is quite helpful to stay away from the markets for a few months and then to come back and assess whats happening  with the fresh pair of eyes and and when I came back and I looked at the and this this and to men that and bill has just mentioned have us is that the data its a bit surprising to me how bearish the sentiment is because even though we have seen some growth deceleration  globally  X. U. S. as gross it is still well above trend at in most countries including the your area  perhaps a China as well did it despite the slow down and so  yes the growth is slower  but to analysts nearing recession and Milton in the US and unlocked in the now the significant country and everybody seems to be on tenterhooks nothing tidy Im not talking on the sentiment I would disagree with the view that sentiment is bearish I do I do think sentiment is bearish  I I think expectations of stew for risk assets to deliver positive returns in two thousand eighteen and for the system to to hold together  Ive Ive been through bearishness  believe me this is far from a baby shin varmint when when people of bearish  a you can you can fuel up very  heightened level of tension and and feeder markets but its not , Notre its a seasonal bush bush absolutely not only wanted to a year ago relative to a year ago I see that we , were not much different  veces a year ago the differences that things were X. rating picking up a year ago I two D. I we passed the peak  things are slowing down and once the level  a  of BDS indices indicators might be the same as it was a year ago  you have to be called the fact that today we we passed the peak yeah it its its like come when Napoleon went to that to most school  P. he went through various places on the way then he went to the same places on the way back the mood on the way back was very different from the way they I think well see look at positioning asset manager positioning and actually people still general F. Y. X. two system underweight bonds at say even if they might be more cautious in what Im what Im saying its not necessary being reflected in in those found weights other being more cautious in what theyre buying in the overweight equities are they being more selective to think I think people are still broadly long the emerging markets and and probably as selling them as as this this years progressed  study that sought that date to it in case if if thats kind of am I guess is a good indication of peoples risk appetite and for the more I think you would have to take that cyclical say down and convey blade what violations at night which is very high on a sixty day just a basis and say in that environment when valuations hi Im great throwing a that it does make you a little bit more worried okay will at some move on to something youve already spoken about  so it which was the trade war which is ramping up as we speak between the US and China how worried should we be about this because Im initially people were very sanguine that you know the the the first round of from of tires that were being  Anands to deny didnt really make any difference there is just a little blip on the  on the charts but it does because the more serious and I think thats right the the initial announcement so very much miss enough as trump just doing what he doesn and sending tweets out not really doing much about it and that hasnt really prove to be the case that I think seventy four percent to impact I think that as a negative sentiment impact soap to whats going on from an asset markets Bective and then the second three sort of I guess thing have to cry as well how does actually affect the the dates are and I think it does affect the way that  businesses behave and how they think crime testing and if we look at China Chinas already cyclically slowing sales so I do think it makes that the Chinese economy that five involvement Im bill on the trade was you describe this as being the in the system what what did you mean Hey what I mean is that a weve weve enjoyed it   very schmooze  free flowing treating marmot and today a macro economic environment the last thank you thats five years in markets of being dominant and day efficiencies house being sought out by by companies and  and  is benefited by the notion old applying power and and and slowing global trade  and encouraging companies to to have fever domestic production over a production and the the lowest cost environment does kind of depend comments Hey armor in a sense the equipment  putting great in the global economic machine I use your in in in encouraging inefficiencies into the system and and and thats thats what I mean but I meet that goal and it would you expect this or when would you expect this is not showing up in the in the data well its really hard to say because of  very said set and does not just   didnt in the size of the tire if the amount so so and the and retaliation  by China or the country this and what products to are affected and what whats the whats the substitution elasticity is there are so many as variables that you would need to know too precisely estimate the imperfect but various estimates suggest that actually the the mock cream booked it is relatively been now I in a could be relatively benign in terms of growth and inflation and but to also thinker and if we assume that this is going to be it  yeah protracted the fast I the its not the mid term election and I think its actually going to  continue over the next two yes  it helps in some sense like breaks at that were not going to get a big negative shock in the next quarter because of this its going to last for a long time and perhaps slowly put downward pressure wants to be and I put pressure on inflation but its not that one quartet phenomenon and and in terms of her that reflected in an asset markets  I I think its reasonable to expect that in the short more test probably very modest  a adjustments to to growth expectations time was not but to a small Im but the the discount rate if it might be a bit greater  a introduces on sentence into the system it depresses me Jim tam growth expectations Megyn tem expectations about investment  and and and thats a set price negative because that thats one of the things that is really interesting that nobody can really dissipate what president trump is going to do next so how do companies react how do you how do you anticipate how this is going to play out over not just one courses you say on at that time but I have a multiple multiple is John , I think that thinking through this up as we speak  said there is some talk that perhaps if your company producing something in China maybe you go and move your production says hes into Taiwan of Vietnam and and you elements the US that  but then maybe the secondary consideration is a well what happens if trump decides that he doesnt want us to do that and then comes off just in time on a Vietnam  and save probably a bit plays back ready to our faith and honor said is that you get a period of , doing nothing stagnation all messed up on these decisions and  thought at the time is quite negative and I think its a useful way of of thinking about it this effect is to try take trump the picture for a moment and and think about US policy  for a number of people of suggestion of  go some simply this the even if trump hadnt won the two thousand sixteen election the U. S. would be taking a more aggressive stance on on the trade front and particularly with regards China so if you accept the US policy for several years looking forwards is likely to be I focused on changing in the US is trading relationship with China then what one can make some judgments about how that slightly to play into financial markets bring trump back into the picture how he zigzags around that direction of travel frankly as anyones guess  and  I I dont think anyone could see with great confidence that they know what the next move is going to be but if you know the direction of travel then you can submit Mason judge that might be right for China they but if youll Europe pool one of the US is historic allies this is all coming as a bit of a shock to me and say trump has ready made this a much more a global issue Feb on and not not just China specific she and this is why I ask about the global economy because Im saying many economies a matter into linked with the global economy with the the trade this is  traveling Im , through many different markets pounds for different whether its pulse with friends  pots for college have you I am it could all start to unravel and thats thats the the great in the machine you do youre describing and and a little more detail the efficiencies that weve taking advantage of the last thirty five forty years  if you start to tear apart do supply chains I then this is the machine wont walk as well as it once did I think  say things given the cyclical backdrop that weve talked about for Las for months deteriorating things always look a bit west through that lens and if it wasnt for the fact that growth is already slowing I think as the same markets might take a more optimistic view and say well this isnt going to be a one quarter effect but its the backdrop that colors the thinking as cycle yeah and that and I think this is an important point that Charlotte Mixteca if we go back to over eighteen months when the cycle was swinging upwards  investors are inclined to the new longer ten negatives because the focus on the fact that things are getting better and to add a lightly to continue to get better once youre past the peak and the the the views  becomes actually things are getting worse and maybe going once again the you look at those longer tam influences a slightly different way at Roland fission to one side you think , what what what were cyclically slowing and that a small things that dont look too good either and that that that please this is mine , well I think we all need cheering up , the lights I nights that term its time to play hot cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy it like hot cakes and what would you drop like a hot potato salads well see your heart can accessible I need say a Mexican Im at , currency Im even the act to market I think weve got three that the west of the uncertainty with the elections and  its a structurally healthy economy suddenly  relative to best of luck Tom ferry sinks into the US which is still doing all right and for how much longer hi fi prevent longer  and this could be some catch up to help the your home protection European equities , you dont have a very certain at now access and  Europe is , to some extent leading that the down swing    sent me on a DM basis its its one of the the west am from in markets hi its being called in the the head winds of of trades in the notate which is Japanese the big part of pop European equities in I think thats a problem okay Im at your hot cake was he and using it as my  back Im actually going to go full and EMI could this emerging market even though structure today  I dont particularly it  like this asset class for a number of reasons I think talk to Katie given the correction that too afraid to see in  it might be a good topic to you too right now at a A. again on the very worst place to be a short term basis at yes within emerging markets and outside but to as as a concept to as as an asset class I think it is attractive at this point in time what would you drop like a hot potato well the flip side to has to be the Dolla at its its extremely hard to have a very high conviction on the dollar right now and that I hear all sorts of fed a little different different views and different arguments  but at four AM to do well at the door of the house to the I. the Italys be stable or to weaken somewhat and actually I think we have set the and narrowing of the interest rate difference those particular between the fad in the C. B. and some other banks I have my Tim Hey give rise to this trend it is today over the next two months to the end of the year so I think we could all the  so cell a cell the Dolla sent him to okay Im bill at your hot cake Hey Michael case actually really to to put on is just described I think that those when we can its likely that the the US economy is weakened  and I think US treasuries he ate the ten year bond  would that deliver positive returns against that backdrop to Im a buyer of ten year treasuries and your set of rules and Im a sailor all of the semiconductor sector  Sammys are famously and violently cyclical and the last two years has been wonderful for companies in the semiconductor sector I but there are signs of the fundamentals freeing  and  if if I continue I in the vin has the the the last few weeks I had then I think we could see a meaningful selloff in semiconductors and that thats an area of six zero triggered by the increase in the system right well thank you very much indeed rest of time I hate that give me some insight into thinking behind this months axis education if youd like more detail is published in full on our website and if youd like to discuss anything because it just ask you for that he contact thanks very much my guess Anna showed us the bill and on the phone James of course and thanks to you for listening well be back next month the fan I goodbye , this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part because is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sent it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest other important legal notices presale website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
5,6,"hello and welcome to the August edition of rich pickings fidelitys asset allocation port coast Im Richard again today Im heading back to our offices in the rain but you have to hear it has the loan whole summer in the U. K. come to an end it certainly feels like it today is the long Bull Run in both kids coming to an end well thats a rather more difficult question one that the team tries to once a in this months discussion Turkey features of course along with China this policy decisions are there enough of how long can the US keep maturing alone listen on for some rich pickings , joining me in this zero three of the multi asset team who had a day to digest the asset allocation meeting an estimates your global economist hopefully manager George S. stuff up close and James Bateman chief investment officer we always start with an off topic and yet probing question Anna if you could become an instant expert in anything what would it be add that to the best on the me an astronomer yeah I always looking into the stores and wandering thoughts fall but you could be telling somebody in future George I wave my rich pickings one to make you an instant expert in some picking the Turkish language is professionally or personal interest fully but both Im being Greek take is is is in a bit of the same time take is in the eye of the storm on Id like to see if everything is Tom mom or not Tom to moms looking Turkish a very good day will come yes Im sure fresh from his holiday James youd like to become an instant Ancha expert in so I was torn between two Richard so either  early twentieth century pretty shocked or  theoretical physics so you know either  reading all right next to us in any his entry not enough of an expert excellent I cut right lets get on  to you at the business now attends lets start with the allocation headlines this month whats whats the news or indeed is there any , I guess whats interesting Richard is Im a lot been going on in my okay spit in the last few days  real concerns building real worries we spend hours debating and discussing and decided to make no changes to a positioning , now I think you know you have to characterize that in light of the fact that we had de risked wed move new track hes a couple of months ago with the view that they would be volatility of a summer there is volatility over the summer period weve assessing the meeting actually almost questioning why dont we more worried about that and I think the aunts was we do once we had no idea what the cast list would be me said he didnt it was gonna be Turkey no one its its said that three months ago the fact of the matter is  we had expected something something has happened and were very much sitting back waiting to see what happens  could lead to sturdy risk more could just lead us to  body assets owned  weakness okay Im breathless through what the indications are if you can show so we are when you track teas were overweight cash Im underweight fixed income in a two broad asacol sense within the regions we are  we got very few positions on with underweight the you we continue to be under way the U. K. Im Im way overweight Japan and Japans key a very good risk off area including the currency okay and now for something completely different you may recognize this Kelly sendo of shepherd turns and how it affects the keeps on rising higher and higher building tension anticipation that something has to happen but it never this , can anyone see where Im going with this  yes lets talk markets the rise and rise and Turkey youve already alluded to it James could it be the thing to Holtz this bull market for a good note George Im you describe a perfect storm hitting Turkey I am a yeah eight states oversee not to maam in Turkey what what did you mean well Turkey has actually been one of those countries that has been identified with a lot of excellent abilities as we have been seeing a liquidity being ring from the system into the fed raising rates Donna being strong and Turkey does have excellent abilities what has happened in more recent months is which is a big difference and has led to the to the more recent selloff is lack of credibility after the the change we switch scene of the central bank and on the same time a political situation that is making  investors very very uncomfortable with the US you mean with the US indeed so where is it gang have how do you  feel event Turkey  its a its a its a situation that is changing a lot day by day have you changed your view on the country James so you know we dont have a material drip positioning just just in Turkey anyways will have emerging market exposure both when acting a day perspective but its its broad and diversified and I think our starting point is when situations of this fluid to moving this fast thats not the time to make rapid changes in the portfolio so I think you know what when I think about Tokio thing about implications Im not really focused on the first Dr Tim impact which is techy stocks a Turkish bombs Im thinking if it really goes wrong if the situation really does get out of control what a second of the derivative impacts so European financials for example contagion risk into other emerging markets and and I guess thats how within Q. more broadly I think were trying to balance that and the the the fact that maybe want to reduce some risk that in in in in prospect St Tenchi happening with the fact that maybe at one ten actually maybe this is a storm in a teacup and and six weeks eight weeks down the line the when I moved on back to a positive narrative George do you agree is is is this is a risk of contagion or is it contained that is the key thing weve been debating in the team how could the transition mechanism result in in contagion risk and us James mention it could be actually through the banks of the banks actually stop blending into all the parts of the market especially to merge market friends that have a lot of external at that at that a lot of dollar for instance hard currency debt but is Turkey an isolated case the way that its going wrong does that matter is it idiosyncratic definitely love elements for dissing credit risk in the sense not Crittenden credibility lock off or the political situation , most of all the image more countries dont have both might have won the might of the other but dont have both not perspective a bit more dissing product but we still to worry about that big the potential contagion risk and I know what you think I think  in Turkey is said A. S. systemic country in the sense that   the crisis had the potential to spill over to  other markets particularly to those countries that also quite vulnerable such as Sam nous of Africa Brazil they have some other major markets and its not the sort of for agent in the oven is Sather that to have seen over the past few years its big its  very vulnerable  and this is all happening in the environment where a global liquidity is getting withdrawn as so far by the fed but also next year by the C. B.  the and some other big central banks so I think  it we shouldnt be complacent about it a particularly in the late stage of the cycle where are the risks said and I since the fighting and if it were to spread we would be next you think well it perhaps the and the the most vulnerable yeah Im so that for cobra sale  over all that time they have says central Europe as well even hello they do have the C. B. potentially  helping but to mention Brazil that really would mess it wouldnt it as a large economy yeah exactly its its very big a gay in them the exposure  off of foreign investors said it to corporate debts to a sovereign debt today is a big plus theres this still dont have a stable political situation and James whats could trigger this contagion was he looking for as you to express a very fluid situation in Turkey but some what could what could make the spread so I mean I I think the the interesting thing is you never quite know why you get contagion because that she it sentiment in its panic and its essentially Im the the the average marriage if the average market to sprints narrative shifting from we go to isolated from to one that could be more systemic so  it one thing that could could you make it most system he simply arm eurozone banks being forced to write down  all right of Turkish debt and I would have a massive impact on your it would also though I have a big impact on other emerging countries where I think the market would start saying what if this is Nixon I think Brazil is a clear example where that could happen that the market says okay Winston was hacked into keep very bad we in the next is going to be  Brazil  the bigger risk in that its not just that it happens to those countries but you get a massive negative sentiment across will emerging markets indiscriminately we saw  Indian currency selloff  quite some she  on the Turkish news you look at that you think will actually India is not in the same situation but the market sentiment is depressing everywhere  and that thats what makes it but well systemic Bakshi more more into a bigger impact in terms of the overall market and I I want to know that this this contagion and that  James is talking about is is not going to chess spread to Yemen stated that  this is it this has the potential to be such a big financial shock that it would spread to DM  markets and  including the US and with tightened financial condition so dramatically that it could affect economic growth elsewhere but particularly developed markets particularly the US and I think I can come in what what what whats particular interesting a moment is the US has been almost immune to it its been a little bit of Wallaces here the lost eye but basically its been immune to it and and that doesnt give the US a an incentive to help resolve the issues clearly if you start seeing it impacting the U. S. you economically or in the markets  that changes the US is is incentives intent of time to try to resolve the Turkey crisis and both politically and in terms of policy economic what was it what I think you can separate in in this in this case I think that the two are actually intertwined okay lets me to the bigger picture Anna you said in your briefing yesterday that the USS conditions for the rest of the world China since the grace agenda for the rest of the world it is a mixed picture for chinamans isnt it a it is makes the growth has definitely been so  weighing and as we know they have big stimulus that to a soul in twenty sixteen has been a slowly  was drawn sold their investment in infrastructure has fallen  quite dramatically and and then we see that  the some of the activity indicated sells a slowing    on the other hand   theres been some small steps  to try to limit the downside to the growth of it but theres a sense thats a does SO policy is directed towards his come winter raising a probably not going to be enough to put the floor to the slow down do you agree Georgia they committed if enough probably not get although they have somewhat changed direction and with change of direction also comes opportunities so one of the areas that weve actually been discussing the team is Asian credits China high yields China credit and thats been one of part of the what part of the market that has actually sold of significant since the beginning of the year a little more than European high yield funds and on bank of the Italy situation and weve been slowly so looking about this as an opportunity market but what looking then for a catalyst and this somewhat change of direction from China we thinks has put a bit of a stop in the spread one environment and views are actually very attractive okay so thats China was about eight AM the ricinus festival here from someone with concerns in the short clip , as usual weve taken refuge in one of the stuff kitchens here at fidelity for quick aggression with a portfolio manager Im joined this time by bill McCracken bill hello to you hello that the the economics looks fine in the states the fed is on courses maneuvers the S. and P. is up whats not to like I think this a variety of things to like Ashley Im worried that this  complacency to run the United States as you rightly say a lot of good stuff has happened but if one looks under the surface and lets the future as far as on the surface is concerned the consumer is fine but if look at the housing market and if you look up bottles I see a surprisingly weak for apparently healthy economy when Nighy consider things of salute hello parts the world like today high oil prices and the fact that real interest rates have risen response the US is not immune from that and its still enjoying the benefits of the weak dollar last year but this year the dolls me stronger and I think all of those things in the second half of this issue might begin to wait on the on the US economy it could be that that optimism that you describe is has got fairly short shelf life so Im not as good as I was painting and  I presume that that means that you are under way to yes well that say thats not the case as we stand at the moment  and that is really because my E. my view this year has been that we we want to hunker down and be somewhat defensive with apple fully allocation and the US is a classically defense of market so to to this point Im actually likes the US equity market but for the reasons of just a particularly to I I think we need to re appraise that view and to make a judgment  for the those defensive characteristics will be is helpful in the second half of the year as they have been the first bill went on to say that the awesome self every day whether the US will continue to serve as a safe haven Im ana are you as concerned about two acres as he is Im more optimistic than be alone the US economy a particular talking about to the second half of these here  that and the of course I agree that the US it is in the late cycle and the things that  that and that bill is concerned about  surely the the characteristics of the late cycle the helps the consumer the house instead of the housing market to an adult dissected said truck but there are two key things that set the US economy to the end of the year and potentially through twenty nineteen and that is the fiscal support did the fiscal boasts a terms policies that have given such a lift to the economy at yes the tried to that and  also  the mantra policies of again if you look at the financial conditions they still remain very accommodative perhaps in some tightening  all over the last few months but its still not enough to put a significant job when you is gross so I I do agree that two are going to see a slow down from the full percent to the growth that we saw in Q. two  but I dont think a its going down to Trenton below trend its not going to be a very  drop it  so Im optimistic for the end of the year so all things being equal James Im certainly nothing to knock markets that it should it should play alone I mean it it could leap and event sentiment could not the market and its its not but trajectory  has been  almost unbroken  we saw a bit of wobbles in in the tech stocks not that long ago about I must be very positive and I and I do agree with Anna and and you alluded to that time Im not long back from holiday I was in the US and you the positive sentiment that the sense of confidence from the average consumer is unwavering and and the confidence is a large part of what drives the economy markets and that is positive and therefore I think the US it is characters typically defensive thats good if if markets rolled over but he could I think it could well continue to lead rockets off I would just like to autumn owns of the mixing of the defensiveness of the US market in , my my thinking here is that when the problems are excellent out of the U. S. thats when the US market becomes a defense of market if however the problem stumbling in within the US market Im not sure its going to be exactly as defensive as investors expected to be especially at a time when funds investors are the highest I location overweight to the US equity market that theyve been in a very long time so is primed for something to go wrong in a sense that in addition with very narrow leadership that we have seen a very few number of stocks that are pushing the market higher precisely okay James made a point in the meeting at bank tech take some time horizons being underweight doesnt necessarily mean setting off today Im how does that put plans simple for use , so I think youre clearly when your when your investing  used to be taken sits on a daily basis on a monthly or quarterly basis and on that basis you might think were trending towards an underweight were trending towards and Ive wait the time those positions I think when we look at  your emerging markets now one of the debates we had these is this a buying opportunity should be selling at this point for example give the techie situation and I think the aunts was hold false but with the view that you need to be quite tactical on a daily basis but in what happens and and youre one of the things you have to think about whenever managing a portfolio is whats happened today has the market over reacted versus reality but should I therefore change my positioning and and particularly when sentiment to shorten sentiment drives markets the ability to take very short term decisions when you see a what effect you become is an irrational dislocation can I have a lot of value okay and lets assume then that  things Bible along as they as they have been for the next couple of weeks or so when should we start to be wary of a big shift in   in sentiment if we look at the the last few years its been very late August early September when volatilities picked up a bit we see a bit more  market concern Im not sure whether that is a kind of cliche back to school or whether that simply is people beginning to look for to the to the net yeah and and looking whats going to happen this time this case in twenty nineteen rather than just focusing on twenty eighty so that what drives it but that clearly is a an element of reassessment point , and and I just spent part of it is market participants must be back in the office looking at things with their heads reassessing but interestingly every single time weve seen validity that markets of then read resumes the opera trend and so  I think it would be very very  worrying if you took the view that because that was happening  because that might your service substantially risk off George youre about to get away on holiday , are you gonna be happy to switch on your out of office reply until you come back I guess so  when when one goes the holidays I guess they always happy to do that but tell you no one has the has to be on on top of things even even went away because it is August theres a lack of liquidity and things are moving what I would be looking at is to what extent we see this spread wanting environment continue and if we see also currencies across image markets continued to devalue vowed would probably then lead to naked more negative sentiment could potentially to outflows from emerging markets that would make me worry a little bit more okay well were almost out of time but not before we play hot cakes no potatoes what would you buy and fuse as in like hot cakes and what would you drop like a hot potato Anna , US so my hope cake is the Japanese yen versus the dollar and I think it has seven  both the fundamental reasons the two to be stronger relative to what it is now  bottles of because the sentiment is and its its one of the a safe havens send our data in case of a and U. shocks a crisis and my hot potato would be  net Latin American equities said and emerging market could just within the last Tom haves versus Asia and going back to the theme that we discussed  on vulnerabilities within them and and also  they have already done quite well so I think  that would be something to selling that city okay George you hot cakes my hot cakes would be M.

6,7,"hello and welcome to the September addition of rich pickings for that is hes asset allocation part because Im returning as Richie and this move on in the church of St Mary Holden Mary I place for contemplation and I believe restoration by coffee from the shop at the back Im gonna put my cappuccino to one side because in this months part because we delve deeper into data that suggests the slowdown in the global economy maybe about two Bucks a night how emerging markets might not that sunny picture and why Australia is better than New Zealand yes indeed listen on to find out why joining me in the studio  three of the multi asset team back from this summer break and already deep into the asset allocation wrangling they are sold at Herrington markets and a shot at this month I want to know before we get going whats your most Iraqi no fear you say heights which will there but its not tasty irrational it does become a rational when youre in a hotel room say and you cant put the curtains in the customs for fear of looking out the window it does so slightly old good tonight also with us is pull for the manager mass grave messed what nonsense gives you goose bumps Im really light being rational side every having a rational fit but I I have this very irrational thing of after gay snowboarding I dream about set and I wake myself up because it our full labor in the dream I actually , jump out of bed add to the point where my wife now and sleep in the same bed as my house is ready your wifes rational fish if you know bless his heart this is headline also my third guest as always is James statement chief investment officer the most yes it seems James whats your mixed irrational fear well I guess I would never admit it was a rational but Im Im not a big fan of spiders but since some can kill you Im not completely irrational as I say and certainly preclude certain Im jirga areas for for holidays city gave us as eminently sensible to me but to before we get going as he quickly how the group decided to position itself this month has that been any change to the multi asset allocation what Im sorry to disappoint you Richard but they dont Sir is no  you might as well be over ten a positioning which is neutral equities overweight cash underweight fixed income we did have a bit of a debate whether we should actually neutralized our cash and fixed income positions as well so be neutral on everything we have that but you know you cannot change of position without passing through neutral and and the margin we will probably over the next few months be reducing Cassian increasing fixed income so that would just be a power through a move that we know were going to likely to make did you set this up for it so Im very well Im sorry did you agree with them where we ended up I think absolutely Im probably a bit more risk of us in that side from the Fateh hold a bit more duration and and be a bit less positive on on the equity market  logics of just the fundamentals but also because within the equity market Hey its really been the rest of us is the Reston that and that sort of convergence sticks like its impossible and Matt said how are you  are you willing to the rest of the group now Im close to Charlotte and probably mainly on the ball on the side of things   Id like holding some duration hand as a see the logic I applies if you put a recession at any point in the next ten years three percent looks pretty good on  US ten yeah  and their phone wins hold pretty swell M. for a bit more detail on the numbers in that discussion Michael set with a market analyst in some some a dust him a banks fidelitys leading indicator the fly its been stuck in the negative and worsening court and for six months in a row exactly what you dont want it to be but he explained that the person of the cycle isnt yet hit but may be near welcome to guarantee conferencing system are you going to the conference IT honored by hash I wouldnt quite say theyve reached the boss in the accounts here cycle track at that that momentum its that negative signal is is being fade out there is some sense of stabilize ation now I always caution not treated too much into this bus , given the fast food indicators designed sweet growth by about three months that negative deceleration seems to be blossoming perhaps around the turn of twenty nineteen we might be talking about actually things stabilizing not for could drive that economically well weve always said that there hasnt been a significant enough my crack Im in shock given her strong growth was last year its really move us Fuhrman at mid cycle late cycle into actual recessionary territory theres no real candidate for for why that should happen so stabilization I think was always something we expect his and that is something that the it looks like were getting a bit closer to a serving sort of teetering Im on the brink if you like for it for a number of months but it suggests that perhaps  the world is becoming a safer place economically speaking what could knock that theyre in sure well it has to be emerging markets  right at the cross hairs of slowing Chinese growth a fed tightening in a stronger dollar and and more idiosyncratic blow ups are starting to see in in the really vulnerable emerging markets the likes of Turkey and arch Tina at any Sadie syncretic you mean that at the conditions that are unique to those individual economies Im not the sort of thing that might spread like wildfire through other countries sure there the conditions there so much worse than they are in other emerging markets in terms of current account deficits X. around us in this I am so much worse the we dont think you can extrapolate from there see India Indonesia at even in Mexico I havent so follow these countries we little sounder pressure still it doesnt feel I crave retain existential risk stage quite yet , after the tone , in some some will show that I can see here I am do you agree with his assessment , I think our our imagine what it specifically thats been obviously thats been where the actions been Ole Ole yes I we see in the currency that can okay on the fixed income market will set off quite aggressively allies in says its been down to a stronger dollar this the fed tightening and and and Chinese  grace under say trade tensions with the IRS so whats the move has been quite aggressive  the conditions  that had sort of form the backdrop for that made me largely in place  particularly on the China so things where yes they are starting said to stimulate the economy but were a long way from any seeing that the day to change off the back that and it James Ian explains how , the conditions in Turkey in Argentina unique at least to some degree if you could be that but what about the other countries with a bank this idea of contagion where should we be looking for  and and and be much more concerned about it special so I think you know youre right towards the question  when it when you see a an issue in a country is it systemic is it or is it yes and critics reserving the critics exports and apply lots of other places or is it contains to that country that region and I think when we look at Turkey we dont see it  structure is a systemic issue we dont think its something that we is light impact all emerging markets and that she therefore we think to the extent that the negative sentiment around emerging markets have been over done  it may be the the the other Everest rising in terms of countries Brazil Brazil pretty has a tumultuous political situation and I did and he will be the next Turkey but I think that there was a real mess of more than Argentina its a large part of the market  with with a lot of Im pretty much a household name stocks I think whats interesting about this though is that although we might identify places I Turkey is  being less systemic actually the subtle finances been very broad based say what we sing and into needs servicing it in India all these places are supposedly in in it and about this situation answer its its hard to ready to draw a line so its like a rational response perhaps but the mood is changing around what I thought I think I think they said she three levels to is a one is  is it purely idiosyncratic   is it systemic but though it the way you he described before as as that idiosyncrasy going to affect everything else but actually the pockets of issues you see in EM have an underlying systemic  elements to it the US dollar liquid the the  the tightening of  of of money she posts in US and Im the the the fact that that puts it it kind of is it makes the tide clout if thats exactly it its sort of leap from from going from one event to the other but actually Im everything is might might not have that particular story of the day but everythings moving in that direction it is this global backdrop of of slow Grayson honest on the dollar and in fact the US seems to be staring a lot of that you forty race mass but Im can you explain it more Sean is about why the American masses so much at the moment , I well from an active sect of its obviously a very large part the index from fundamentals perspective  the the US set monetary conditions to sort objects ten four unless the world and say this is a , Roger  pace of normalization as the as the federal puts it is is starting to tighten policy not just in the hospital SO elsewhere the feds has the same day so that everyone else has so whats interpretation that everyone else seems to be hoping the fed is going to be pushing on that data yeah its interesting so the fed I think of  laid out that that plan if you like to be need to see a which is to to hike rates tools neutral which they estimate about two point seven five three percent and then take polls I dont see a huge amount to ready change that view at the moment  I think its entirely possible that US great slays a bit from heaven that that rate hike parth still ends up in in the same place but perhaps slow is in terms of the pace maybe skip the courts  over seven  but but that would be that this of the interpretation on FNC but just to go you take take  shows point a little bit further  you the fed is essentially setting monetary policy see for a seventy percent of the world in commodities financial systems a lot of old depend on it but the feds mandate isnt that the feds mandate is domestic and say what what youre seeing to a certain degree is this  disconnects between financial markets and natural mandate if the fed and youd need  either for that  domestic pitcher to change  for that  other pitcher in the rest of the world to affect the domestic pitcher for the fed to really take note of it and change the course because of the box  if no man is an island stem the fed might realize that  its own economy is going to be affected if the policy that it sets affects the rest of the world and this is the is a subject that gets wrestled with the law and there are different opinions on it and and  I think thats where it comes on some personalities within the fed and how they interpret that but I think they would really  have to interpret that as its going to affect the domestic economy FO a greatly guys do this but it this is this is the thing with with what she policy its its its  it it hasnt necessarily been set at a time when it when the fed has been so dominant the financial markets so I think were gonna have his slightly see what see what comes of his how exciting make a couple of observations on that is that if I see that there is evidence that the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy are being impacted by higher interest rates say housing vehicle sales the alright sensed isnt and thats slowing I on the other point around that the FMC being being quite balanced and and then as I see it right some of the issues for them is that youve had a boost from tax cuts  which which we know is is is temporary and right to to fade in and that makes that job all the more difficult because they dont want to over tighten into a picture that ultimately its going to slow on it saying quote  and said I think that that adds an extra twist with this its quite a short term twist as well because we expect that stimulus to run it by the end of next year by the end of next year which is a when you think of the leads in lax and policy making and you know try to set policy because you think it will impact the next yeah that sort of explains why it why theyd on the more cautious side okay well thats the way that the policy is being decided that of course  affects the US economy but the biggest driver an American colony  its its consumers Im how healthy them in you it looks to be booming at the moment tens indeed it does which is my thing you know whats interesting is is the that both an actor stand and in the data consumer confidence is very strong  and and what are  on the planet you know Alyssa seen recently is the ability of a corpus to push through price increases so regaining pricing power consumers are Im continuing to Spences that which is or was he a very strong sign for the economy and deeds I think some of our  Intel estimates suggesting that maybe were pushing out the downtown another year in the US economy so thats pretty major think the related point to that theyre coming back to the fed a minute she policy is is clearly the  if if firms will have pricing power  as a sign of further information to come I can deal with what comes information just a moment the other thing that perhaps might undermine that rosy a picture is Im not everybody is convinced by the future of the US economy it seems Im if you start looking at capital expenditure cap ex , that companies say theyre going to invest but seem to be sitting on that couch instead so there there are Im Christian hi countries of so thats been a film in in the in the US market for a long time the interesting point that that one of the options me this morning to us was the its its getting harder distinguishing cap ex and optics Im in tech spending  and therefore actually look the headline numbers might be giving that you the wrong impression of what companies are actually doing so they are spending you sick companies definitely spending a different investing what we we might question whether its enough we might question whether theres theres an element of caution with some companies but at the same time  I think you do you do you find it hard to build a narrative that said US companies are acting cautiously a marring about an imminent downtown then not by rates but Im I interrupted you earlier when you wanted to talk about S. inflation your famously worried about inflation are we now entering a time when you feel is come true I think my can my concern is increasing  and that she is as we discussed last week in a in a separate conversation  when I was invested one of the the the books required reading at the stop was the death of inflation by ritual and ever since then it struck me as a bit leave the inflation is over as a concept  and we just seemed unusually long period where the this is a move to central bank independence in the nineteen nineties and benign or negative economic conditions  have combined to mean that the inflation hasnt hasnt really read it had its likely to again its most likely to win people arent expecting it might still element of naive it in the market about  inflation and and either you getting wide ranging in price inflation you got the impact of oily puddle of those together and you say this feels like a precursor for above target inflation inflation surprises it doesnt feel like a country in anyway worried about to these things at the moment doesnt the US no the US on behaving as if there is an inflation problem passe but I think it is likely that in nation continues to to grind up in the environment that were in I think whats really stock while the inflation picture rule is how much its been impacted by courtesy prices say the pick up an oil eventually feeding three from headline into corn face in an at and say lost it might not be the kind of wage generated inflation that that would worry the fads it is delimitations people feel it , yeah and actually if you look at real wages going by the US consumer real wages are are not looking so healthy because it face of wage increases is is being rated by the inflation picture okay well were almost as the ends now which means its time to play a hot cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy a like a hot cake would you drop like a hot potato showed it was your hot cakes , Im going to say that the utility sector within the act to market  intensity well when  eight four but it was it as well when the X. market ten case that taxes are at say if you had the environment in which right so she spiked schools in the act to set off then I think you to seize was still do quite well in that I do hope to to what Im SO make a set to trade science the consumer discretionary sector it has always under formed in in late cycle and actually this optimism around the strength of the US consumer its a little bit worrying given all the other things that were seeing in terms of that the space Lincoln the I Im mentioned  and and these interest rate sensitive sectors okay some to watch Max was your hot cakes what he really liked what I meant given I made a reference to snowboarding either Im going a bit off piste and with the  lost and all of us is  have it easy and are so it was a veces Q. E. wise  with you can see quite a large divergence in and confidence in the economy yeah in surveys  between the two  and generally this  divergence of the economy implies that that cross should should should  should go in the benefit of Australia and to continue snowboarding thing what would be the white pack two whats your say so he had to wipe out my hot potato is yours how you  its been having a great time because of the tax cut because the US is doing so well but its been completely it means everything else is going on and it just feels like the area that could go wrong  if all things go wrong the cable down hill from hit so  James finally we come to you your hot cakes my how cake is  somewhat controversially come competitively some my colleagues views  Asian emerging markets I think  sentence beaten up too much they are structurally undervalued Im not you to produce chances phones wells you pick up the currency of got potential for double rebound writes a critic crisis spiky spiky one that would what you hope station so the my my how potatoes Europe and and and and and Ill Ill explain second but but but I mean for a while it has bass was inside of my Im so you worried that this upside potential for brexit deal so Im Im off the European equity market  as as a hot potato because it could bounce  but Im really worried about your pin corporate that  simply because  when with the macroeconomic picture isnt great continues not to be great bricks it isnt a structurally structure improvement that Im seeking to get sentiment bounce inequities its not its not as as a structural  and therefore Im worried about  declining fortunes for European corporate start to mean priced into the fixed income market and the ECB stepping away at the end of the year yeah I said I dont that happy note Im afraid Russia time I hate that give you an insight into the thinking behind this month asset allocation if youd like more details publishing for on our website and if youd like to discuss anything weve covered just ask you for those he contacts thanks very much to my guess so much James and and thank you to you for listening well be back next month but then I could buy , this podcast is for investment nationals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of an since can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices presale website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
7,8,"hello Im Richard again this post cost is for investments professionals only the best part of a decade the global economy has grown and grown but the red early signs of the tide may be turning and if thats the case then on running for the hills whats an investor to do the old rules of either being for caution or no longer well in a world very different the one before the global financial crisis Im Richard after in today Ive got the some of the dentist is leading thinkers to help come up with the answers how to invest in the world last session joining me in the studio  Sonya lands head of equities Steve Ellis had a fixed income in Europe and James payment chief investment officer for multi asset , a question for one of you before we get going at the risk of being indiscreet your old old enough to remember the crisis of two thousand seven and two thousand nine but young enough for it to have shaped your career is about to thinking six what Id like to know first of all is what surprised you most in the years since during the great bull runs let me county James Russell so I guess I I I pre begin Richard by saying Im quite surprised will cut jobs  if we did feel in in a in all right Im Im in the office are broken London next to the womens building watching everyone leave I did feel like that was the end of the financial services industry and actually the fact that finances booming maybe in different ways but actually that the industry is in pretty good health yeah was this the bins mission trust the industry  constant investing was still seeing a real equity market was in the debt markets returns no manages well nor that treats and is a surprise it was not not with us an awful lot of help from the central battle without help but you know do you in in in in September right you felt the end was nigh by March  knowing you were enjoying the start of a bull market I mean you know that that that was quite surprising I think how quickly you know animal spirits began to return Steve havent you well I think the  the thing thats really my surprise when since  two thousand eight has been extremely sub youd nature of volatility and I think you guys parts were you saying which is about the help from central banks in his supplying huge amounts of liquidity the balance sheets of the G. three banks is increased by about eighteen trillion dollars since then this provision of the crazy thing is pretty responsible for the very subdued nature of the could see of faithful soci rather and  still has very much surprised me that havent seen more regular bad civil associate given the fact that the in a debt levels in the global economy now is so much higher than the way even back at the  the thing that the eve of the crisis back in two thousand eight you still expect given the leverage is being ling up picking corporate send off part of town she banks etcetera that you would have seen much more periodic episodes of volatility and risk aversion but markets have been extremely resilient and durable an engineering company apps we we will come to that I suppose they throw yeah I think it is very possible are she because the liquidity tops of being turned off right now and the cheats world setting the fed up beginning to unwind spongy and and raise interest rates and that could be because in a certain cause some problems going on right it was sunny was about you what surprised you about this  this remarkable periods Ive not quite two decades , I guess bringing the the markets perspective in a bit broader not justice fixed income is how well we have all done in terms of asset price inflation and I think the most striking feature to me is the fact that markets across the board including fine wine old time us and any other kind of sellable S. its classic custom has done particularly well and has out phone three to call me that is it is it is a striking features so its not only that we have jobs but how well those with jobs have done on the back of the extraordinary monetary policy support and this is why to me the most important question is if a Steve is just highlighted we have now turn off the taps what is going to happen because we have to assume and this is something we have witnessed already and since the beginning of the year that actually markets can underperform the economy just because we have a very distinctive change in the way we have been supported for the past ten years one I think your Chester County can I come with one comment on that sorry that the I think Sonya hits a very important point that the that youve seen a disparity in the returns from being an asset to being being so not she works and yes we will have jobs and that she a lot of countries unemployment is low but we havent seen wage inflation missing tends to science now but after a decade from a route from that from the the start of the crisis on the average workers maturity better off and that is a very unusual situation nine years until she is in trouble mock okay one thing you rule sets us up for discussion then and what a nice twenty now is whats the situation at the moment when we find ourselves right now Sonya six what characterizes this particular cycle and where we are at the moment think the striking feature of twenty eighteen is the reassessment on where we on the psycho how assets in for M. S. of price inflation stacks up how valuation level stakeout and the volatility that has started really is just a sign of this reassessment because people try to figure out whether the risk and the risk profile fat and  of the pot full UN as a location is adequate for where we on the cycle and and the the idea that growth might have peaked oversee raises a lot of question marks and we havent even touched on politics all the other headlights that of that I am around and and Im really kind of raising uncertainty and and unfortunately means we we need I mean all the rules seem to be in trucks up into the air at the moment so you cant look at anyway  and expected to behave in the a that might have done before if we got to the stage in the cycle which he turns up see rich and I I think was interesting Im not gonna some the table because it will make a trip from most of my friends but if I did come the table without water crosses on it youd see the water well below and then the the the waffle so gradually to go actually thats what happened this year the volatility that yes we have a spike in volatility but youve seen that will assist you again receipt in the market Im not so what at this point in the cycle is there are so many reasons to worry yeah from from in a basic valuations  prospects for future earnings beyond you know maybe next yet geo politics etcetera and yet actually we we see one heard of volatility and then we see that gradually reduce over the yeah and and that is absolutely a typical at this point in the cycle so if theres not a add a jarring spasm that comes from somewhere Im it sounds like its going to be the turning off the taps thats  is that is the critical thing here Im Steve Im looking at you because the fed is clearly fundamental to to what happens next what most wary although Im as it transitions from constant easing into tightening well which I think is the key thing for markets right now is the move from QB two QT in reducing the balance sheet which is about four and a half trillion dollars and fed rate hike as well which  does he tightening the liquidity and also the huge amounts of televisions in a trace reassurance thats taking place because of the  the budgetary expense at the very life cycle  and so that thats training huge amounts we could see what the important thing here is Richard is that that the liquidity is being trained in what we call the off shore but the liquidity market in other words this is kind of the year until market which stemmed from Petra dollar its the huge amounts of the liquidity which is flying around the global economy seeking yielding seeking exposure to risk assets Im in environment very subdued him  photos he but is now heading home and well to what the reason why has hasnt so far hit the US I think is that at the same time youve had a huge amount of dollar repatriation  it because of the profit repatriation eccentric by in in  invoked by trump and so the the if you think about this to see the statistics here so since April Im money supply into money supply in the global offshore toll equity market is that she formed by two point four trillion dollars its been a huge training to the could see and thats why much markets have been under so much pressure is because its really tightening the could see for in a corporate sovereigns whove been him boring in huge amounts of dollars in also , whereas in U. S. M. C. money supplies that she increased by about three hundred fifty billion dollars because of that money coming back on shore in other words using a cow so account drainage from the off shore and from the emerging markets back into the U. S. the money supply growth is that should be quite robust in U. S. and thats why youre seeing very good performance of asset prices in the U. S. whether its investment grade high yield US markets etcetera but soon relate to that tent that Templeton off as well and  its gonna be a lot more  in difficult for risk assets I think what what what might stop the fed him its not obliged to look international with the picture its irony is Monday hes just look within the US I am whats going to what we could knock them of course , well I think you have to have some severe market dislocation first  and whether that happens  indirectly so in other words because whats happening in the match among its right now which seems frankly very low probability that is going to derail the fed from continuing with its fed rate hikes and trying to to liquidity I think it has to be something on shore the house that that has to happen now the way to see a massive  spread widening US high yield US investment grade which causes a very sharp tightening monetary conditions that  I think thats the only thing that can really derail the fed and suddenly calls and to go on hold and to stop the rate hiking cycle until two the bond she on want and its very possibly could be an extra there if if I may this is very important because I think this this is a bit of a change because I think on the power we have seen a much larger focus on on the domestic issues than before Janet Yellen would would normally refer or boot see her much more as a global central bank of them what what Powell does and it will have implications because you know it it just shows the interconnectedness of the of the global financial system and with it whether they like it or not they are at levels they they are indeed but the point is that obviously we we focused a lot on Argentina and Turkey and there were lots that would claim that their idiosyncratic risk in this jail pastas and I I hear this but at the at the bottom of this is still the problem that Sam Steve has just outlined and which walking about a shortage and Donna liquidity M. and two you could add to the on the performance of the global banks in the old from equities point of view that literally point in the same direction there is stress is in the system that so if I have only really focus on the weakest links but we should not be know them because they might have wider repercussions going forward okay with us to get the other side of the story from we are looking at the feds for interest rates Im growth has been driven globally ready by China James  in in recent is double the contribution of the U. S. but that might be ending because its award the slowing at the moment how concerned should we be so I mean I think me to look at trying to in into context one is Im its had a phenomenal level of growth for for decades and secondly its slowing yes but from very high rates to still quite high rates and second a context is the last five year Congress the party was very clear its intended to enact policies that would solve some of the rural urban divide but at the same time would slow growth so we took but summing growth they for because that was gonna happen its happened and is happening it said the real concern is not does growth slowed is it what often gets good hard landing does it does it full below me I may be a a reasonable expectation I I need my base case is that she knows the heat of the fears of China  over exaggerated every century to partly because its a very easy and popular narrative to go with because the the data is somewhat chooses how to read you know whats going on  but when you actually look at trying to what youve seen is is a companys what is yes here in this real estate market see a rolling over but you sing out she consumer confidence  in Italy some areas up tick some error is not one but its still positive   but one and orbited data and that for you know you look to is actually a bit of a review sing a bit of rebalancing but if change then roll back and take a big picture look on China and say well actually if this sort of what they called a second real tertiary cities but those cities with populations actually about the size of London so not small cities have virtually no infrastructure yes our industrializing Austin in a world in which you have a country that has cities with populations of five to ten million with that she no infrastructure  the there in the prices of dust rising being used as a source of labor often actually by the west tool in in in in trenches there is a phenomenal  potential for upside key theres the risk factors right and if we cant even with the potential for a trade war or the front window trade will depending how you like to define it you know my guess is thats a bit of a storm in a teacup in a couple of years will back and say okay maybe there are some tariffs in place but its been broadly Rizzo but but that does create some some short to medium term downside risk but do you do I believe the engine of growth is de railed if outside fine China no I do not if from , kid does or doesnt see itself is the the worlds central bankers Im just China consider a it has a role in global cracks a Sony or is its  purely  domestically focused they they sort of came to the rescue lost time thats a very interesting question and  I think its something that will be redefined over the next decade also because were literally a Im on the edge of of seeing the old kind of world older changing quite dramatically and in that context we have the question around the world central bank and the reserve currency and the worlds kind of growth drive and so far it has its been a clearer picture on whos who this might change over time and I think we just currently if you look at the shorter term picture always the and in this big kind of unknown whether Im the new normal for Chinese growth I think we all agree will not provide in you stimulus and thats important differentiation because it means for us from an S. it embed  evaluation point if you that they might be not a new catalyst that kind of we could hang our hats on and say oh well thats great and that thats the big differentiator because of and for the posco love yes China always provided this new stimulus wet where this time out they might not do this and just accept that it will be at a lower level and more sustainable level of growth and I think thats thats the big the big differentiation I think for the time being I am thats more per obviously has a domestic motivation because its around obviously the indebtedness and the sustainability of new debt levels  and has a hands you know you probably could argue this is more domestically oriented but we have seen a much greater awareness of their responsibility into of global foreign policy and that kind of position on the world stage which is the change and mature as for the pasta absolutely and so for the next kind of ten twenty years is really the question how we would see this relationship between the US and China develop views inevitably China will be the larger economy versus the US and  interesting your was he now Mr trump seems to try to defeat the world order they have established pop impose what what to so there will be lots of interesting kind of side effects that will come am about the stupid I think you know the point you make about Sean is very important because when I think about the world for the tenants to fact is on the foot on the one hand you look at the fact the fed set the global casa capital through fed funds right and then directly by ten year treasuries etcetera and you know the  the seat that term interest rate differential will drive the dollar so is the if the US really sets the the cost of capital I look at China and I see China assessing the global rates of growth and so the two can in hand so he think back to twenty fifteen when China devalued its currency in August of that year and it was going through a massive capsule counts  reduction so the money pouring out to China the currency was the it was depreciation very rapidly that we did see if both of these by can markets and by February twenty sixteen China was in a real mess the growth was stalling  they cannot live gross too your record do I was sort of in a five percent or so so they tend to tops on in my system and the day credit expansion of around about four trillion dollars which is about forty three percent of GDP in one year it wasnt busy it was an enormous amount of leasing it works well and it lifted all parts of the ink thats we slow the cyclical recovery C. on the one hand you have the fed who still maintaining very low interest rates except for but still on tapering but to them it was the was China that re stimulated the global economy and listed all parts now youre in a situation where Chinese growth is against doling which is not surprising give in fact the China has pretty much stance on death and not debts is going as having less and less having diminishing returns coming less and less productive for every dollar debts and so therefore the huge miss allocation resources there right there in trouble again so what do they do they go back to what they always do and they want to stimulate and so the question for markets right now is whether not China can do another busy Kerr and I just dont think the cameras thing crime son is exactly right I spent I think they they will do everything that turn to at least mitigate the slow down but not to re stimulate because theyre the biggest maximum beginning the year was because financial stability was de leveraging and so therefore you know all they can do as a physical response hip but just to to really soften the blow but not to actually re stimulate were off to the races again , you mentioned markets and I want to move us away from the big picture we got the the scene are set into her this translates into markets because we are in this peculiar market at the moment the unloved  bill run James , where do we go to now is there a bubble that feels it has to be popped    Ill be at that stage I mean it Richard its you never know we are in the market cycle into you to leave got pasta  so so we will turn it to guess the impossible but I think you know my my my my starting point on that is is for us which can be true I mean we know it when were on light see economic growth matured a separate from yeah that suggests were probably late cycle and we look of adoration Cynthia given whats going on from the late cycle conversely arm its been a , the other thing that surprised me since the financial crisis is how an enjoyable this bull market has been Im yet to see a anyone particularly enjoy it and I think part of that the emotional scars of eight the will last with us throughout our careers soundly but equally that hasnt been that sense of animal spirits the hasnt and that sense of excitement has been that sense of maybe this time is different on the way to be the animals the win be the last hurrah well yeah and and you know the the the the challenges that is that that debate between  you know saying were in new paradigm and whenever you say that  youre proven wrong and so it is entirely conceivable that we have a a but the the when we look back in the in ten years to why we had a bad market the ons well be the re pricing of us its based on  zero right for risk free I stone  access and finally could you all these other things Im was actually the bear market so obviously coming because people taking too much risk tracing yielded has more time is  hangs and thats what we saw was a cover version is as rates rise for some of that is entirely conceivable but I think it is also entirely conceivable that we do see  a period of excess momentum in in an area of the market and thats the point at which you know you start calling  the true lease of late cycle boom that the the you want to want to DO restaurant there is one thing I have which is clearly you have seen a lot of trust in the fangs I wanted it we can talk to without talking about my brother didnt offer the fangs my favorite phrase get Im I Im pleased with if you like that Richard Ive ever had right so while drunk , but but you know its not that momentum in the textbooks is that  such a narrow one the the in a white maybe Im a bit less markets and a few stocks but but sunny actually you can you can lease it yeah no I think youre youre absolutely right and I think that is the reason why it has not been an enjoyable market because it was just a handful of stocks and I think its very M. I dont know whether we have any historic precedence where market leadership from a regional sector and stop effective has been so narrow that M. you have without any exposure to those you had no chance whatsoever to produce what we obviously as an active manager is is called alpha so there was very little chance to outperform the broader market to my mind it is a sign that its a very unhealthy backdrop as well because it tells me that investors are hiding in what has been perceived as kind of relative windows it clearly has worked and and weve debated at length you know how is this going to be resolved can we assume that the either the fact to all the style bees or was he in that context we have to mention that value has underperformed dramatically am growth quite obvious because if its around tech stocks its tech sector and its the you Stan its clear that it can only be found in in growth and and momentum Sir can we expect you know in the context of the end of cycle assumption that this is going to turn dramatically and I think here we came to the Luzhin knows it it can only be and negative resolution I II we have to see those segments of the US the tech sector and the fine and the bats I guess I have to include two at least market perform under perform before we then obviously long side hopefully a new economic cycle C. M. what then would be a much better value backdrop and that more what we have right now but but but but then that then also classic bubble okay that theres not hype around those particular companies that theyre very successful companies connect that would disagree that the hype is not broad enough to make it kind of this hyperbole kind of expectation that the whole market with M. M. expand towards the end so this last hurrah because its only five stocks can we see them you know all perform yes but the point is and we Im talk about opportunities yet M. the the expectation that we have is at least that we should start looking at other areas because they they have been left out so dramatically which is so unusual about this last part of the market right into the the interesting thing there then and and the thing I havent completely reconciled in my own head is youve had this arm the last releases French crisis this growth in in  fact by stressed you smoke because rushes a lot slower which a minimum volatility minimum variance etcetera phenomenal way to money going into them Im and yet theyre almost the anti fangs because you know theoretically those are not low volatility stocks maybe they all day out of hot off was finally all but while bey and there in lies feeling yeah but but youve got something that is only going up and and the the the buyers of those strategies to my mind are people who think that buying things that dont have a lot of calls to price momentum and therefore out she would do in a down market Im sick ways and your question of of the the the I know its its kind of Im just wondering but you know and therefore it should is that that is one if your wrist to disillusion owning the courses across about market crisis is people dont get one getting from their investments what they thought they were getting a youve got to areas that worry me one is that she people think theyve got low volatility low risk stocks arm and maybe have the fangs the other these people whove bought what they perceive as safe stopped because they are yielding income giving an income answering come  but I actually either the income isnt sustainable or simply evaluations and pushed up so much that they still they still have wrote risk of capital loss  and I and I am site you are here we saw and in the end we do you know Ive talked about it a bit the set of caps is this world in the Karelian switch what companies simply will not sustainable business models I think one of the things that could crack is perceived state save companies because they had a yield on so because of the lack of free cash flow behind them so those the the things that army where do you go in that environment  it might might my starting point is and and senator value exponentials and I view that to an extent is a bit of a to a bit more than sunny does I think the I think there is a possibility of a change in leadership that says Frank star under performing other areas the market the way too many simply rotates into them Im not pushes those up Im the second point which is possible important is of value again exponentials in a down market could be a very attractive place to be with the nexus and you have to think not just whether I want to be in terms of between us across is but also within and and to my mind traditional value  is is the one area that could be a reddish too good to a position in in in in the current environment okay well come to positioning  for for this in a potential dental what whatever comes next Im a and then itll well but Im Steve let me come to you weve we weve got all these distortions and peculiar behavior , in the equity markets what about  and credits have things behaving they havent watched it which is the transition that youre seeing at the moment , well you know the big seem the loss V. as in credit markets has been  hunts for yield and thats being perpetuated by very low interest rate environments and not just the need to to find some kind of form of  returned and thats generally come from from yeah the yields rather than say from duration except for  Im I think were getting to a point where now is interest rates are going higher its going to make it more difficult that you know we still in a very low photos environments of people still hunting field at least for the time being but the moment the  weve seen quite resilience in some markets in particular in U. S. high yield and investment grade Im also in U. S. high yield because in Frank is that for the reasons I mentioned that in the U. S. you see in the he is seen money coming back on shore in the money supply is being grossly robust in US  supplies being very very low and the US high yield market so Ive been actually quite surprises her resilience to Israels other parts which is a much market you seen a very large selloff in spreads new scene quite shop dislocation in this market sees it postponing the inevitable there in the US , I think so but for the the key question for , investors and and you know fixing confesses in in general is really what happens next its not only the fed is the cast list for market corrections in every every cycle ends because the for it over tighten and is a risk that you know you look was priced in now for the fed  weird not to present such funds target right  we got to hikes pricing for the show Im one and a half next yes Sir if the fed ex she continued through and she deliver on this for thanks we can have a fed funds rate closer to three percent so thats going to be thank you hello right is now going to be higher and higher and the question is does this site she pushed the U. S. over the top of the age this actually generate recession because you frankly if you look at high yield spreads in Crossville markets even investment grade for that matter , we had a very virtuous cycle in the last ten years or so he hides it very low interest rates have been very low yields about she made it very easy to refinance and its huge amounts of liquidity and now is interest rates are going higher and the could see is now being drained the hurdle rates more getting get more more difficult foreign sovereign sinful corporate stir to to refinance so the virtuous cycle you know you think about the numbers on the five companies in the world that this being renewed many studies looking at some the reason why theyre still an ongoing concern is still like she  trading is that just by virtue very low interest rates may the ability to refinance in any other normal circumstance they were gone bust we have an economy which is usually unproductive because all the provision of very low interest rates and so they they keeping afloat , but I can remember for now but that can unwind if you see treasury yields moving higher and fed funds rate moving and hes gonna get more more difficult for them to refinance the knots on ones a virtuous cycle and to turn into a vicious cycle so thats the the theres already a signals path from the feds but theres a risk of central bank a policy mistakes which  of the thing that way it will schedules we havent talked about his inflation which could be on the on the rise , oil has risen dramatically  Ive  over the past year I would be getting to see wages rise in the U. S. Im how does that change the dynamic with James said to wage rises in U. S. No swiping very subdued up until now but now with labor markets appearing to be quite tights it could be that these like pulling  in a brick on the floor with a plastic bag and you suddenly nothing happen for a long time the suddenly the  the brick miss very rapidly and you know we could see a very shop spiking wages here and you look at some you look at things I fed surveys and you look at the at lance a fed survey of  inflation expectations the United it does show that core inflation is going to be higher in the U. S. and if thats the case then the fed have to act they have to tighten they have to keep progressing with fed rate hikes and thats the problem is that inflation if Haitian is indeed in the system I I just Im not quite convinced my mind whether well see is because I do think there are some powerful disinflation forces in the global economy as well but if if the US inflation is pushing higher this in the short term the means that the fed will have to know in a they will have to just carry on with the for the that signing the bouncy and a fed rate hikes and that Im afraid could I sheep Netscape the US interpretive stagflation and and maybe I should come in the so I mean Im clearly  and Richard this is from a lot of discussions weve had  the the the the big warrior about inflation from fidelity as one of my colleagues said to me recently what youll be Russian the and you just go to white arm and and the outlook is not a maybe thats true but but you know and and and and Steve is just won the prize for the best analogy of the effort of silly last ex well done arm but but either inflation is worry to me and inflation to worry because I didnt you know I actually think a lot of the deflation the fact is that weve had over the past ten twenty plus years I have I have ended and a and a and an a first reading EM cheap labor as a source is is certainly less second the arm and this is the big one to me I dont believe the internet is is is a is a D. freshly force I think the internet is a process government some and prices have been discovered  so you had a period of deflation impact because everyone could ascertain the cheapest price for and Im not send it in a world without end it Im not sure world where we no longer have sticky prices menu costs because of the internet the people can change is a natural prices very quickly the risk is the if and and we had to  and she from from one of the  youre sexy and lists Im only this week the  companies are seeing the single should cost through a cost increases which cost increases quite rapid its very easy to to do that in a rapid sake she combats does doing it you do it it it becomes a vicious cycle of a frost mage inflation Im sorry the risk of inflation getting high is it will maturity high from sinful men used to for the last ten plus years Im is really that and the central and policy to that is inevitable , to a very different a central bank  situation is very different money tree approach Sonya wedded to the opportunities lie in a more like this , think before identifying opportunities is very important that these adjustment proceeds will be with us for a long period of time so we have to be very nimble and very mindful that this is not done in the quarters adjustment you know speaking of you my the market so so the the immediate reaction function yes can be very short term but there will be an ongoing reassessment of what actually opportunities on how we should look at these in the context of a potential and find a stage of the cycle changing monetary see and obviously from an equity markets spoke perspective this extreme market leadership Sir that thats kind of the framework we we tried to put in place before then starting to say okay what where do we feel we should start looking for good opportunities and that means to stop with all the sectors had to have been dramatically left behind and where we feel that actually we have sufficient visibility on the business model the cash flow the earning stream and where there has not been a massive buildup and leverage against another framework to look at individual come the needs a quick little checklist this is where then obviously the dividend yield and would play it different angle because if we look at the importance of the dividend yield and this is well documented over the long term interestingly over the last five years weve had a much larger contributions for multiple expansion then we had from earnings growth and dividend yield if we agree that because of the changes from Q. three two Q. T. that would not at least repeat itself then the dividend yield and the earnings and growth will be much more poor to determine the attractiveness of underlying stocks and that means that if I look at and some of the left behind sectors and again the most important part is to not buy just the year to buy the business model you buy the earning stream and the cash flow and if that comes with a five send dividend yield to my mind is a very good starting position because in our own capital markets assumption five percent is pretty good and say this is what what what we really started to look at and gives you a good idea on on where the opportunities are and you would but be surprised there is quite a few companies in those left behind sectors which I think are now a good starting position to look at because they should provide you with more stability in what will be inevitably and much more uncertain environment because as I said and the re assessment and the readjustment proces will be with us for quite sometime and it sounds like its not a broad brush approach to sex its not usual so you might find good companies within for health care you might even find good individual stories and utilities but again be mindful rising interest rates bone proxies sectors left behind so theres lots of things to to capture hands what weve said for a for a number of off months now oversee the active selection is key to your success going forward but hands you know having a good framework on what youre looking for and what you assume is going to be the changing environment will help you guys you and navigate the market backdrop Steve what about fixed income how you re adjusting to this whats the whats your approach when youre looking for the opportunities well I think in fixing community it is pretty simple and  may I think the biggest opportunity right now is more in the short duration income types Rushdies where you know you try to mitigate some of the  the risks from rising yields and and you know by having the short duration type of  fund exposure but also you still need to income and dust in as a key thing for many investors I said who could very much a defensive type of stretchy but still generating sufficient income to to you know provide to the the return investors require and ensure is what strategy is a U. deploying now that you want a little while ago how things are changing in multi asset so I think I think Richard  and Id Id not to screw them expensive so far I do think its time what Alfa matches Malone be to arm and either the that thats two contacts one is  I think we learned from  seven was you had this way too many moving to passive are seven massively disillusioned and all right you do not want to be  passive light cycle in in most markets because the the the both because returns can become but also we see a downturn in the last thing you want is to own the whole index the second Arab offer that Id Id really want to focus on these is will tentative and it would be it whether its long short equity market neutral at such a strategy is the on line to the direction in the market generator but instead said reliant on skill of Aussie more attractive at this time because they are immune from market changes immune from these environments provided that the underlying managers making the right decision and therefore that reliance on alpha in both areas is is ramble from I just tangentially out of course that all  what we like to cook hes a terror attack areas of the market be the asset leasing  either social infrastructure sector areas where you couldnt you can , Im investing the beats are innocent there is a B. to but its not hard correlated to expertise and forget it just provide you some immunity from those traditional asset classes where there are some you know not from concerns at this point in the cycle the time that I have to move beyond the office and into out a little bit more variety exactly thats a much better way fitting thank you well we we we come to the ends now I just want to welcome each of you what keeps you up at night its been this long  bill run its being old  but it hasnt been bad Sonya what worries you , the complacency he that market still show towards the idea that the roof we we have we are facing a regime shift the idea with that we have very Im used to the support from central banks and massive amounts of liquidity supporting all asset classes I think we we have just seen the first inklings of what might be ahead of us and I think we have to be very it just aware and and number to make sure that were not missing what might be quite profound shifts and could see a Webby very aware James what about you will keep you up so Im to the things this is our sales rigid but but but specifically in the in you know I think what really worries me is is invested dissolution arm and you know what weve seen since the French crisis is the millennial generation since she not participating in the stock market by saying its not for me what worries me Im in the in the next bear market is those investors which is the majority of the the the the population across the world who have participated in this bull market have invested become disillusioned because what theyve owned which they perceived a site full perceived as as yes because because there is level city because they thought it was generated income turns out not to be as safe as they thought and we know investors have been pushed up the respect from to the  the older generation who is seeking an income there is a real risk for capital loss and that just two men could mean in the next cycle the sum is much money on the table because not many people wish to to deploy  money in in in in traditional market so that but maybe thats why hes in the most the the when we see about market  he could have a big psychological impact  this is for a very long time , okay and  Stephen deliberate he come to you lost  I need to set the glass in front of you on the on the table here is Hoff empty from a fixed income points of view what keeps you up well I am I do I can fix come the full by the very nature we tend to be more the better side  I I think that its  the the the biggest risk for me and what keeps me up at nights is when missionary ready the subdued nature of volatility Im not saying hes not the implication of that is that when as a NASA manager we do know we stress SL funds and we the funds would be a shame that the level tilting rhyme it will process and so it is a respectful so he does spike they could because  you know everyone to reassess and and to see Ill have risk assets will once and I think the  the the deal setting well the thing that makes things worse is that the technicals in the market very very difficult to sell because its a very small exit to with some of the the cancer parties a banks in other words having in a much lower bond issue tolerance and  therefore they its going to be its that the liquidity that they provide to us and as hes gonna be much less so if we do see the whole spike his results of the fed no tipping us over the edge with fed right Acheson training should look to liquidity  it could be a very small exit door first because hassle everythings freezing up well between the I think youve give me enough to worry about it tonight but Ill take comfort also from the areas where you will think there are opportunities in the in the months to come as we come to the end perhaps if this great , let me thanks nice Steven S.

8,9,"hello Im Richard again and they split coast ease for investment professionals only the passion of populations is changing in many places especially the developed world people are having fewer children but theyre living longer emerging economies have quite another trend um in the under thirties sometimes too many for the countries to find work for youve probably heard all this before its not a surprise but what did these huge shifts mean for societies and for investors what challenges on the for governments businesses and individuals as my work Ive had  to support or employee the old the young I DO cells with me in the studio to discuss demographics all three fidelity experts first David buckle head of investment solutions is on here at fidelity David parts of your job is to think in novel ways about how people can fund their retirement whats the most significant shift that youve seen in the way the industry is approaching this above all the most significant is the notion of needing to invest in the retirement phase as opposed to cashing out to eight six five and  in other words that each does not a done deal youre going to carry on trying to keep some returns for the many years that many people who are retired now in in a pension since belief too long  and therefore the money doesnt last it needs to grow at least through the first phase of retirement to make sure it lasts for the rest of your life talk twenty years well with me also is a portfolio manager  I need to Vinnie co who runs fidelitys demographic and consumer funds now Im Anita I imagine that but the areas that you cover complement each other the impact of changing populations and their behaviors whats missing interesting trends that touches both of those one of the most interesting and fascinating trend is how people today in the fifties finger that they are still young and how they spend the money so we all talk about aging can we all talk about the population declining  this pending public declining but I think psychologically people are younger in the mines the younger older innocent yeah thats really good okay and Im completing line up today is Judy Ann Webb  global head of fidelitys workplace investing business note Julian your responsible for and the pension schemes of so one million and investors all over the world Im hello  the needs of those members if holding they are certainly change in  in light so if what we see in in some sort of global demographic so the changes I think the most fun to so the thing is that people now have their own responsibility for that retirements I think the shift is clearly moved from state to either the private individual or indeed their employer so I think people are now recognizing they need more support and help to say full  an adequate retirement income so a lot of people are having to get their heads for this is not just the people around this table Gillian and David at an S. at welcome to you all Im to set the scene for us please what challenges do the demographics  whos in places which are getting older yes this two big ones the first one is that when you retire you have to fund until the eight the point of your death the longer you live the more the moneys got to last that thats the clear driver in demographics and because that face  is actually quite short in in the sense of a lifetime just a few years extra longevity actually mean quite to begin back to the work your savings have to do , the second thing is is a question mark about how much the state can provide with the demographic shift of how many young people supporting how many  people its not clear how much pension division can come from the state in the future so how did the economics underpinned order if this affects those points youre making at the not helpful actually he under the economic growth these how many people are working and how much is each one producing at the population growth of the world is slowing so theyre less people Wallace growth in people so we need them to be more productive and with an aging population actually typically that corresponds to a lower productivity I tried to pull productivity is is a a symptom that we sink in many economies particularly these are these I kind of is that a growing older in the tech yes okay well I am I need to order the sounds very boring I am and yes the demographic funds that you carry around looks for the opportunities that these shifts  throw up so youre looking for the good news sign , radio eight some optimism in this country okay so so the demographic fundus along on the fonts obviously we are looking for the good thing else and  the faucets add the most exciting news hes the Aug that the older people would have to spend money on that  basically trying to stay younger and how to feel longer attend to severity clear trend  did the medicine technology that  and the companies that I come up with solutions  the the baby boomers retiring baby boomers have very high spending power and this I said before did they think they are young they want to enjoy their life  and and and theyre spending patterns are she sting from out of this from  Finks which are  may be necessary to fing sweet  may be much more discretionary that allowed them total to enjoy life and and and and stay stay healthy and fit so what the types of things that youre looking for a way to you specifically start to sort of pickup  on those those changing trends so something which is maybe very superficial but  skin care company is a big by the fishery off of aging because us us we know all us we hope this can go product still help us looking younger and and Ive seen studies that show at a lady in the fifties buys  five times more products the doubts that the AT who is in her twenties as always the companies that sell a skin care products are quite  quite the clip on the fishery but really good if you got the same for men in their fifties and how much of it is with men in their twenties you know the so we are now talking  the metro sexual man who care about what they look like a lot actually and in Asia we are seeing increasing demand from meant for skin , and  this is driven partially also by social media where you want to produce to Amy trundle Keyong  so we are seeing a quite a strong trend on of crew out but it snowed the baby boomers I think it would be the the the the generation of millennials as they got all that youll spend more on my own skin interesting that June I Im going to a , your skin care regime and your your your social media profile can study to , you look fabulous for those of you who are watching in a black and white its great Im Im , weve weve got people who he was living longer that feeling younger Im as an S. it was explaining it wants to look younger Im the Russo staying longer Im in work Im how all the companys having to  to adapt to an aging workforce yeah I think I think you know the science Tenchi lot of value and benefits to employers particularly as you know the the most senior in age that work force is the more experienced by definition they can bring to that organization and I think you know hiring young talents can be quite challenging into organization so retaining youll senior more experienced talent I think its also important so what we see in our a lot of  large employers in particular having a much more flexible approach into all of the night when people would expect to be retiring they all design in that benefits structures in a way that accommodates an old a work force as well so I think employers absolutely understand yes however to Davids earlier points that probably comes a point in time where the older generation become less productive so equally employers dont want an aging workforce that is becoming less productive said I want to make sure that they are financially secure so they cannot she retire at an appropriate age a not just to have to continue working for income purposes I suppose theres an element of education as well Im not most of the companies  but of the employees  I as well very much so very much so and one of the big big trends that we see in particular in the U. S. is this concept of financial wellness so I think historically employers really focused on retirement savings and making sure that that work forces are adequately que to full for retirement income but I think increasingly whether its full the older generation or indeed the younger generation this concept all of financial well being financial wellness beyond retirement another was beyond retirement savings so whether that song short term cash flow to debt management your familys financial wellness as well see in  employers such not these programs to inform and engage with the work force on this broader topic of financial wellness , David yes and it extends into every training as well  its on lot you given that this is old at the same time as a technological revolution its unlikely that people have a single career for this force lifespan so the likelihood of needing to switch gaze mid career is becoming greater and these milestones that are now of a  for how close are you to retirement point  you will probably need to check those milestones at the same time of potentially shifting gear in your career , do we pay as as calm as can entries as economies how do we think about paying for people and  that retirement Im because that has to change as well , yes this this typically three pillars switch people laying on the first is the state second is the company the third is the end of you can state stepping back in many places yes you just look at that the **** numbers  that thats the number of people retiring the number of money on the balance sheet and  is lot do thats going to have to shift certainly , is an Indy you save a planning for retirement I dont want to rely on that government pieces a significant part of of my retirement yeah I I would just just quickly add I think I think the state clearly plays a really really important role in baton a provision particularly for the less well off I think what we see in is this shift from governments focused on good quality adequate state provision for the lower paid , and then for medium to high paid individuals putting more emphasis on them to save for their own retirement become less reliant on the state so I think thats quite an important shift but I think you know overruled this is a fact that actually state  want governments countries do want to backtrack a little bit on this provision that saw the by reducing the absolute amounts of retirement income that the state provides often and increasingly increasing the age when you become eligible to take those benefits the transfer of responsibility to individuals yes I am but at the same time as a transfer of risk from the companies that work providing defined benefit schemes to defined contribution so there is an awful lot to peoples gonna have to rent it of the succeeding in in this preparation I I I think its just started in reality I mean this move from defined benefit guaranteed retirement income to defined contribution is really been involved in I the last twenty years but I think the reality is in a lot of the countries in particular that you know thats a more mature countries that I actually you know the concept of defined benefit is more or less disappeared a lot of people say well thats a negative thing but I actually can be posted so if we bring it back to the demographic changes and the flexibility that the work force is looking full actually having defined contribution can be a significant advantage so for example in retirement we note that  yeah when you just retire youve hopefully  youll you health you need to enjoy your free time you need more money so you need a higher income at that point in time and then as you become older actually you less mobile and probably have less of she did see too you know enjoy your free time and you need less money than the third and final sort of cycle actually she goes into later life you perhaps have less good health and you need healthcare so spy that you need any help okay spend thats right and if we need more money at the end wheres the defined benefit plan by definition gives you a pretty static level of income throughout your retirement okay and and these are the persons and I see that you were talking about active Im what how youre trying to a sports where the opportunities are is because sweet we see of his seat a lot of the developed countries but also some of the emerging market countries aging quite fast but this a drink at this point in time is mostly the baby boomers moving to a kind of a bit more advanced age lets lets not called that old age at and its a time where the days they still have a lot of saving spending power and and winning this to spend on enjoyed their life on the maybe the on its thinking so far ahead but also this is the population that has a lot of water in the houses they have experience to the global housing boom and they have quite a lot of money saved in in in the main office at that they US so if you see the question planning forward from that for dummies when they go to into the eighties will they be able to run east to equity from the house and use dots to pay for the advertisement and for the for the for the cat that they were new so I think , in the late sixties Im not yet so concerned about the need to to  to actually have savings and made maybe thats thats on  responsible on that part because time flies quite although that duration that co holds have goals assists and this is quite different  to people who are who are following them I am , and they are also the people who tend to vote and I just want to bring in governments here Im David because Im post the problem in sorting out some of the fundamental issues around here is that the that the electoral cycle is to foster for anybody ready to cross the nettle and and and make some of the painful changes that perhaps needs needs be done yes thats correct yes the these the the cycle of retirement is way longer than the cycle of out of it the election  and of course as we get and  do notice society they represent a bigger and bigger group that the government said John it to pander to two invites about I I think that the the overarching problem here is that that pensions state pensions out she have been around for that long and when they started you receive them when youre sixty five and the expected life expert lover spend see was forty nine that was really designed for people who unexpectedly lived on so the notion of you retire with still fifteen twenty years of life left in you do cruise isnt coping holidays and all those things that was never really and full in from the governments perspective so what is the  answer that we we we realize that some things arent as good anymore and  people let you look at me and go to work until a mid seventies mid eighties or beyond what long we would go to work but more important if youre able to say youve stopped saving that thats the most important message and I think I think there are particular countries and governments theyre a bit more progressive on this doing it well what I think the U. K. actually isnt it pretty well because when you talk to ,  other governments and   and and sort of policy makers often they all referring back to the U. K. as a potential model to follow say for example in the U. K. we still have very very generous levels of contributions that you can make into a pension plaid with full tax relief I mean there are exceptions you know if you get paid lots of money then you know it gets scales back for but the vast majority of people these still on a relative global comparison basis very high levels of contributions with tax relief I think Id also say that the governments by introducing auto enrollments has been seen to be very aggressive because this is now brought a lot more he pulled into the workplace retirement environment which they wouldnt have been in prior to that and then finally I would just say that these days when you retire in the U. K. you have complete flexibility as to how how you wish to receive your income so I think thats had political consensus , in the U. K. all of the political parties are behind it it is very long term strategy by comparison we see other countries who lives its the tax relief or limit contributions because of the cost to the state here now robin taking a longer term view and and SO when your thinking about ways to invest do you take that into account you start looking at where you think people are going to have and money to spend in retirement another example might be Australia where they go to well funded to a system that is not suited decision play Im a pain to your thinking yes I I do think about it but I must say it is very hard because  at the end of the day its about how people make their choices and most of consumption Lebanese actually from what few people so most of the fraternities to invest in consumer facing businesses is catering to the wealthy people as us as old as we all know that he controlled most of the stock equities they they control most of the housing assets are and this is why I think the outlook fall dead consumption and also for the concerned and from the water off that they would be passing on to the children is quite healthy the issue is definitely when it comes to  to people that have not saved that Im not planning for the future and this is a majority of the population  untouched will have implications companies that send products that cater to doctor Evan of population so I do think about about aggregated faces east it doesnt look as bad as it might seem on average kind of per capita basis once again a nice a positive give me an example of some of the countrys than that are appealing to you at this broad level so in the demographic font we are looking at the dependency ratio and that helps us to identify country sweat for the long term the between two for consumption is very gold because the ratio of those who dont work to those who are in the in the working falls is is good on stable over time so these a number of countries Vietnam is a good example India is a very good example in unusually out  but most of the countries in the developed world I mean Japan is leading the pock about  the aging of western European countries hes call its fast and obviously the same applies to trying on US actually has quite a good demographics eight it its being model to be divided the on immigration policy now  but this country still has quite decent demographics and and as a result quite a good outlook for consumption but some of the countries that you highlighted there  the the basic emerging markets  Amy do you pics on  some in  in Asia they are , a different background a different type of place to to invest with different challenges as well so how do you how do you  facts all of those things Im in when your thinking about many years in advance you can look for example a place like Vietnam which has very young population as a country does today actually benefits from the fog dot a lot of the factories are being moved from China will labor is becoming too expensive partially as a result of scarcity of labor in a China to Vietnam and you can see the the creation of jobs at the low end moving told total total more sophisticated higher value and jobs in the search results which we are seeing a compound the slide  Zarras going done open shops and and and having a big success as weve seen that story played out in many countries befall and we can see that happening in the next decade exactly so Im a  growing middle class more spending and what have you weve seen it all before David the question I want to ask you is Im the countries that have the demographic dividend at the moment so theyve got a bowls of people in the low at age brackets all they simply going to be places with a problem in in you is to come in the same way that Japan is at the forefront now and  develops markets Im like Kelly said Germany Im choosing one thats about to have a problem in Europe not not not necessarily and my personal experience of trying to design products full of these different countries is its more to do with the cultural expectation of how retirement is managed so for example in the western world is very common to have some kind of an life annuity product which pays you income through retirement and then when you die the products over where is in parts of Asia where a speech to the response from  consumes there is to say no we dont need that much money in retirement because theres an expectation that your family takes care of you but it wouldnt be acceptable to have that then that nest egg disappear on death the idea being that is then transferred to those little bit tough to you as part of your state so managing the cultural issues tends to be a bigger problem than the the demographic that you referred to for emergency calls he says hes developed so what to the products that you then have  have thought thought three for those markets at for those ones of just describe that something with a lump sum billing payment at the end for example and potentially lower income through retirement to compensate would be more attractive to did some of the Asian countries , do you think about this from a global point of view as well and on on the business side yeah so how players adapting  it particular ones that maybe operation lots of countries yes I mean we all we have we very much seeing these sort of global multinational companies wanting to increasing you have aches so consistent Coleman approach to retirement provision and the broader sort of financial provision for that work full size to Davids point it is very different country by country in tonnes of state provision but actually these employers want more can since the so they want more Fanis more quality across all of that work force  I would also add that you know particularly US , based organizations all right she now putting more work force an increasing that were force profile outside of the U. S. so increasingly they are coming to fidelity and asking us for help with solutions in these emerging markets with  now actually pulling quite large volume of of employees easy enough to start bringing up Bates change in those markets perhaps acceleration some of the developments that its already happening in the developed economies yeah I I dont think its going to be  some and change but what I do know is that governments and states pay close attention to what these multinationals ought to in you know often they are incentivizing these companies to setup businesses in these locations and they watch very close how they employee that stuff off and what benefits they provide so I think this will be very much something which will drive change through these large companies and that change programs to different changing to government to  in an interstate as well so at a government level that taking nexus whats a parent to the changes that youre seeing in the way individuals are able to start thinking about the way that the safe because we certainly right at the beginning of your career it just seems so far away yet most people dont want to think about I certainly didnt yeah and I think that is the reality so I think increasingly both individuals and their employer is a given a lot of thought to this and really thinking perhaps talking to somebody and get she was somebody in the ready twenty is about a two or even a five year time horizon and certainly not a thirty forty year time horizon so for example it may be about that sort of short term cash flow to that sort of management debt increasing the ashy student debt on a global basis is becoming an issue we often think about it as an issue here in the U. K. but its certainly an issue in the U. S. as well and it I think increasingly what employers are looking for is what so simple effective waving K. each in without work force whether its on a short medium or long term horizon for the financial well being so as an example  yet we have come up with  some sort of cool principals what we called in retirement guidelines and one of these as an example is what we refer to as the  savings factor so what mode to pull of your annual salary do you need to save at a particular age to make sure that you can retire on a adequate income so because also youre on track that Im a milestone youll youre going to be okay it exactly right so if youre in for example youll twenties it maybe once times your annual salary as a cash equivalent you need to a forty save your time and if youre in your thirties it maybe four times if you new fifties is probably going to be closer to a two nine times so a very simple way as you say of people just making sure that they remain on track and we can deliver this service in this information in it easy too easy way to axe say for example through a mobile app or on a website so the use of technology comes into play because I think increasingly people want just an easy simple intuitive way of access to this information real heavy rule changes then right across the board fascinating topic Im too damn I knew that we could carry on talking about this for much longer but Im afraid all acts of time now so Julian David and an asset thank you so much for joining me I thank you for listening by , this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this put cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the past  entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest other important legal notices please see our website professionals dot for lets see dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
9,10,"hello and welcome to the November edition of rich pickings with that hes asset allocation pot coast Im Richard again editor in chief and today Ive come out for a breath of fresh air after an intense recording we covered Briggs its white messes and why it doesnt China which everyone agreed doesnt accept and whether its time to buy on the dips or sell at the peaks listen on to find out more well now here with me in the studio on multi asset team fresh from the multi asset allocation group meetings festival shot Harrington markets analysts on it before we delve into investment this months interesting question what is your favorite word in the English language I quite like the word hippopotamus , I like thats okay till he gets out with solid hes cool funny moments at Nick pieces Nick welcome to rich pickings whats the word that you hold in the highest regard wall inside highest regard put on like the word wrap Scalia scallions sounds just what it means yes it does another one  tell you and finally James Bateman chief investment officer mills yes it James give us your favorite movies but in English please  I think Im gonna have to go with inter regnum place because its a its a I think please forward to save it  so  is this wonderful concept of two two periods of continuity and stability with the instability in between any power does he like to draw might suggest the current British  political situation inspired me to that what I would like to comment what we may come to that later on in the program but I thank you all and welcome James lets get to the  to the decisions of the group  how has the positioning of the US occasion group changed well the good news Richard is the positioning has changed so we have something excitings talk about DVD helps the less exciting thing it at headline level is we announce neutral equities neutral fixed income and neutral cash this needs some explanation youre neutral everything we are neutral the asset classes and I and I think you know what we have to think about is is one way to produce of heightened volatility and therefore actually not having active positions can sometimes be the right thing to do but I think secondly you have to position not in a in a in a positive trajectory of moves that for a long time weve been underweight fixed income have white cash and actually were in the versus reversing that positioning  so I suspect next month or the month after at some point youre gonna see is overweight fixed income an underweight cash which is gradually moving through neutrality together so this is partly transit tree but its also a position of saying when you look around you lets see whats going on the tree and prudence combined imprudent says in a in a period of of hi intraday volatility dont take some type big positions because hour by hour your position could be caught up quite badly in the for the timing of any big movies could be paying for its a prudent says dented big positions that make a big move at the moment but it is definitions a tree in the sense that we are moving in a direction of saying were late front with very light cycle that means increased fixed income okay now what about your regional applications because you made a change there is well we have rich in just one change  and and that might seem perverse to to to people listening but but we go neutral from underweight U. K. and replace that with the  underweight to  your affects you K. maintaining the overweight to Japan  wife would not simply we dont have any insights on brexit thats point one we dont we can debate it forever would you debated forever I can assure you its great fun its the topic of of the day every day at the moment however do we think we have an an advantage for us is the market on on on same whats it happened in the potential outcomes no we dont secondly I think you cannot she construct multiple arguments in which the you can market could rally from having a one is it street but popped out for a minute  hot bricks it because it comes from the situation currency collapses currency collapse people move into the market market rallies we know theres a lot of money international money not moving in not buying in the U. K. at the moments that could happen conversely a deal is probably a soft but not major rally in the currency theres a lot more stability people think well you can its cheap and they move in so I am their two reasons why being underweight the U. K. could be actually quite painful in the short to medium term and therefore again as a matter of prudence weve neutralized that position conversely we are concerned what concerned about European and might make message when you think about your visit as a as a region is brexit almost as a footnote on the problems in Europe at the moment if you look at it to the unity of the budget situation youre cut  Merkel succession you look at the changing  leadership the ECB coming for those things really worry us and said this so many reasons why you should be worried about Europe that we think the risk for any one of those becoming  at least for a short time a a reason for a  self in because my sentiment in in Europe are high and the front on the way that seems pretty okay Nick we come to you because youre noting  with great conviction Irans the  to need me to neutral in the U. K. one of the naughty had she started up of multi asset well was it noting but basically on the equity so then what Ive been doing a tongue in my sons very recent is I did is that he adds to equities because sentiment is so you sold that I do wonder whether we could see a rally into the year at James mention valuations and if if you look at  situation excluding the U. S. then the major markets to traded on about thirteen times next year and if grace  and pops is a big if if growth is K. reasonable for the next six to twelve months then perhaps you could actually see a rally inequities on the back of those valuations and so I I just felt like given the sentiment was so negative this call will be an opportunity to make some money and so it you some different views on fixed income you went happy with a neutral everything on the  the the asset classes I guess some of the source of  depends on  starting positions that some Ive been a little bit more negative on base gossips head of this meeting and a little bit more positive on government bonds and and havent really change that fee I would love to sympathy with the  the point the next raised around  sentiment on a very short time basis being quite old episodes and I would see that as an opportunity because of where I started from to cover base about short but to still stay a on the way because I do think that the the greats backed up that were looking at is  is is vulnerable to to slaying again and the technical signals that were guessing sent me from from the models a pretty mixed on a short term basis youre going trying to think markets go bounce but that longer term momentum signals are quite negative first class at some and and supportive of bones and James talks quite a bit there but its   breaks its  but to what extent is breaks it weighing on the minds of thick the group generally do you think I think cemex air broadly people of  I think its fair to say happy to Hanson not take strong view because because things assigned flux and I think as this is so changeable and it was nice and I will probably be outdated by the end of this call cost that said you you work with progress hes having any and youre thinking about and it said to say what what trees may saying that they still no deal   no breaks it is how shes thinking about to ends and saying hes put probabilities on those and and trade around that say my and senses that  markets under estimating the probability of an ideal thats not to say that I think that no deal is the base case it just says I think the markets of under appreciated it so the question for me as someone who has been more negative on on the U. K. is when you start to place that well its because you think the market has started to appreciate it now we can debate that probably for the rest this podcast although he knows will be the prime minister by the end of this call because its all happening as we  as we sit here in the in the studio Im Nick do you have a base case around  breaks in Sir  for went out when the kid decisions nothing I start with valuations and the U. K. market does which she when I meet from manages they they talk about price large cap and now smaller caps stocks being as cheap as Ive seen for a year is  and that for me that may be a reason for it there is but at some point you start looking at the upside downside from a particular company in terms of valuation and earnings and religiously pricing in office have calm again but certainly recession levels  Im when they start pricing in that sort of  outcome then you kind of thing unless an off and on so I dont have a bad time due to but if it gets worse is definitely time to go over what interesting they cant so it says  it clearly at the front of peoples minds here in London Briggs it coloring things  but are we in a bit of a bubble as we sit around this table here what I really I close up with George SO thoughtless and pull financial normally based in Hong Kong will there is here in London for a couple of days and his what he had to say , George as we sit here recording this  I can see a TV screen behind you thats got sky muse running blanket coverage of  brings its and prime minister Hey is giving a statement to the  to the house of Commons its consuming attention here in the U. K. youll based in Hong Kong however the people in Asia about braces I would have to say a lot less worried than my colleagues in in London on and off we recently had a sort of a lengthy talk discussion about breaks it I didnt contribute much other than saying that Ive been having a lot of meetings with clients and investors in the past two years all around Asia Hong Kong Singapore and many other places they have never asked me about brexit so its a its a very domestic political issue always certainly thats the way that its playing into the moment everyones looking into how the government to have the stability the government even but from an investment point if you you could still have ramifications couldnt it could be the source of trick  that that that might  send shockwaves around markets  show  we the put confidentially can you tell a lot of things a connection go wrong this is planned the one of them the could trigger on them I self across market that is a possibility we did see that happen on the back of the referendum two years ago so  so yes it can happen but  the way out I would approach and that sort of scenario if it it was to materialize is that I would look at all the areas that would have sold off as a result of the wood impacted as a result off on brexit Risco from the global risk off and actually that would create pretty interesting buying the pertinentes okay your glass how full kind of guy  however it you said there are lots of other things  that could be  what triggered a  a risk off situation what sort of things should we be worried about it  instead if North breaks it more a rice is recommendation the US especially one thats driven by real rates rising nothing thats been a key elements  full full market worries today and I guess you know I do live in in in Asia China slowdown  can news we have to keep monitoring  how much  further this goes and to what extent is some sort of  further easing policy that is a bit more meaningful for full global markets suddenly my glass is half empty again too thank you for Russian date thank you so it is Im not sure who agreed listening to that its with George that brings it wasnt meaningful for markets I think George is definitely a glass half full person I saw a site you wonder whether actually the interpretation of the fact that agent clients not take some on the U. K. is is somewhat part of the issue which is actually , when things do start to go wrong people peoples positioning is actually much lighter than we think because I say sort of surrounded by bags that we think everyones underweight actually some people havent really thought about it that much in and maybe that is all still to come save Im probably being a bit have mold glass half empty  shattering the glass , the for the points I made it the other day was that  probably the U. K. and praxis it is not something thats gonna worry global investors but actually if the U. K. had signed turn around without a successful deal then the impact that would have had on Europe would have been something was wearing a power because populist parties with that Ive had to act a catalyst to really step up and put pressure on the commission Im pulling out of Europe in the year right the implications that would have had I think that doesnt like him if hes who stitched up I think that is  is very difficult to see anybody else wanting to join us , the Im no comments okay Im good comes James on  the China  aspects this  photos which it which we just talking about it Im up by the Chinese governments willingness to provide stimulus  if and when its needed help how likely is that what youre hearing , you average I think thats a hard one because he tries come is always been willing to she was a managed economy and has she done so quite prudently I think you know it might might there are two concerns I have that one is  the impact of stimulus only whether actually transmits through affect feel whether of Raji reasons  transmission isnt isnt as the governing sprite sorry they tried to stimulate and and you see a small impact the second thing that worries me perhaps is bigger is , given the global economic context can hurt weve had to take ten years of it shin I do wonder with the Chinese thinking you know the the the risks to overheat also much greater than the risks to slow down and Chinese growth is still great for us is most of the world and is gonna remain it probably do you know how much to the reading to do  if we look at the history back either a few years ago at the the last five year Congress you know the the whole message was we want to slow growth and redistribute income more factually between urban and rural this so early in doing that into the the so much more to do and and that is not she about slowing aggregate growth so Im Im not as convinced as a some people that the government wants to sort of take too many steps to to to to boost growth from half way so its Im one of your colleagues just come back from a trip to China where he he was impressed I think by head down beats the people at the two sixty yes and I Im not surprised she really great to have had him there and come back this is in some sense and I went from run  his conclusions because I know hes in the midst of writing it or not but  I think broadly as a sort of them how how we look at the the Chinese dates are in an age laying that with the sentiment that hes come back with  is that yes very very very recent weeks youve seen some stabilization and an infrastructure at that private consumption and wait estates is is like a slowing and continuing to slow very weak retail sales about a third of retail so this vehicle sales it does come back to that kind of global car sales  slow down that weve been talking about and  say after I that exports are likely to soften a little bit as some of these  tires start kicking in that kind of front running fades out say a very hard to cool the bottom in Chinese great hair I think whether we have got to a point of a bit to stabilize ation which then Rick center right so it is I think quite quite possible I think I might set set to Ians feedings having having come back from from China late in the day because in China all very pessimistic and it they they think Chinese greatest living in that policy makers are not yet in a place that they already ready to to do any kind of big banks and I thought it might be that sentiment combined with the perception of the the the authorities in China that actually feed through into a slow down a further slowdown in the economy it could do Anna Anna and ultimately maybe that that that probably the point at which the the policy makers  due to respond in a more meaningful way but prison for life with a at sued taking this I received the the team individual countries China the U. K. whatever theres lots of reasons to be pessimistic Im James  it youll sue sue if Im giving  signals that Im a you know we need to commit U. K. E. shows being under funded Nick you as well what are we are we have a buy on the dips or a cell phone the peaks what I think is a as a group we havent agreed that and I think this is that there are differences between different PMs and I think part of that might be time horizon you know Im not convinced in the next two or three weeks we can see a a breakout up woods in markets but what does worry me is this this idea that the average professional Este is is bearish on the average profession investor is worrying about  the front were at the end of the cycle and markets have a tendency to have a loss to rob people miss out on they can be quite major in terms of upside and it was we have to be prudent and not take too much risk I am aware that the you know what I still think its probably an early next year scenario of a tow truck to percent move in in inequities is its not my base case by any means but its a possibility and when I dont bet to strongly against I and that would be the moment that you know that the its game over for the cycle this is something that I think is a as James had a very on going debates and he looked back at three history any sort of  may make some comparisons and one of those could be the the Asian crisis slash around LTCM the fed having star its high they cut rate seventy five basis points and you go to your body and axes so yeah  its a this is very hard to lay out exactly what you thinks gonna happen we have to have all these sort of scenarios that could play out and could alter your thinking please to leap whichever way Nick  Sir I think its very difficult at the most fashionable but then if you look at certain asset classes there is definitely friendly sweeping biting into Asia high yield  emerging market debt because when youre yields of seven or eight percent thats a great starting point Im with inequities are so large Japanese equities because there I think theres a theres a theres a good micro macro story James you had an interesting idea about hedge funds I and how theyve been performing and what they might do next yes so so one of things that struck me when you look at the data in October  and this is been much talked about these  had from local funds typically try to re editing this probably brought him up he tried a pretty shocking all hope Im why did they have a pretty shocking October because what what transpired looking at them these for the last year or two theyve been very long US tech  either indigent into the sector Im so they werent really non directional they were taking a big directional back and they had a big loss from not need to make that lost back and then automate that lost back might not having positions on to one of my my my kind of questions is with youre gonna see a way to have money from from hedge funds throwing itself into an area of the market and that to moans just pushing out and I do wonder whether that its gonna be a U. S. value value mode more generally but I think there is at least an area of the market you could just see the slew of money coming in rapidly okay were almost out of time so Im excited to announce that today its now time to play hot cakes and hope to take his would you buy a like hot cakes and would you drop like a hot potato Sean its lets come to you whats your hot cakes please I need to stick with the government on V. that I outlined and there I think that the US is more likely to slay the next center right here yeah Sunday that said supplies headwinds but I think ultimately will heal its probably pretty full and the environment and at the same time youve had an easing and inflation passions that at least at the margin  off the back of a pretty significant made an oil and I think thats a as to the isometric M. position at this stage find your hot potato in my home state and this might have been used before but still like it says is short crammed one eight so a play on that China slowdown theme is was a play on the the the weakness that were seeing in this this we conduct a space  and say oh I quite like that , your hopes cake please hold cake when I mentioned as high yield photos are mentioned financials which is generally generally global  to to Europe and Japan look very cheap indeed and thats the thats the attraction was the valuation unloved financials on they always I sure your hot potato song they gave the US dollar  just when I worked fundamentally looks expensive any signs of the U. S. slowing I will see the US dollar weakening time to drop them a K. and James you hot cakes so my hot cakes and Im in a very slightly disagree with Nick is easy its U. S. value   US we have value stocks but I would say X. financials Amari financials of the value of the cycle  in the U. S.  so so so that would be the  cake arm and then hope potato  I think of it he said this last time but but its got to be silly and general Im really worried about a city in and the governments tension with the E. U. with us because if she could just make it your own I think Italian Italian equities at the moment more me the most a city keeping us up at night right  that seats at the listener I hope this is giving you an inside into the thinking behind this months asset allocation feel like anymore detail is published in full on a website and if youd like to discuss anything weve covered just ask your fidelity context thank you very much my guess solid snake for the first time James and George in the recording area I thank you so you for listening well be back next month but for now good bye , this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this put cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices presale website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
10,11,"hello and welcome to the first in a series from fidelity international equity tap the brains of  in has an analyst to learn what their research is telling them about the historys businesses your invest , Im Richard again editor in chief and what you can hear in the background hes one of the worlds busiest ports I mean home cold wet twenty million shipping containers pasta these dogs are quite Xing post every year effects three of the worlds busiest ports are within a hundred miles of this boat strung along the po river does , endless rows of metal shipping containers stacked six height and it sucks instantly shifting panorama thats a loaded and unloaded from the thousand foot ships which Sidle up to the dark side this guy is crisscrossed by giants blue cranes astride the key , China is the worlds menu this is how what they make reaches customers many thousands of miles away in fact ninety percent of all goods made anyway travel at some stage in container ships and their voyages on the worlds oceans keep the global economy the shipping is a big police  just fifteen of the biggest ships from Pat more self dioxide and nitrogen oxides than old of the wells because combined an extraordinary facts , and thats hasnt gone unnoticed the U. N.s international maritime organization is running at new laws that will see six forced to cut their emissions domestically , so what does this mean for the industry what will it cost we will pay benefits and what are the consequences no ones yes the , well , this half those of some listen on to find out more with me in the studio Jonasson needs senior credit analyst covering shipping here if it does he  pull good and senior North America energy on innocent equities welcome to you both not something to come to you first of all if I may some of those numbers I mentioned at the start to Georgia thing  the pollution that shipping generates is breathtaking in many ways Im can you start for civil by explaining the context I am and what the shipping industries mystery aces the international maritime organization is planning to do basis short to the context is that the shipping sector , accounts for just seven percent of all the moms from the transport industry Buck generates approximately ninety percent of the sectors Salford side emissions incredibly out size that contribution to the emissions a belching acts of of bad stuff into the  thats right so the when sulfur dioxide gets into the air you can combine with the more string the air  to form sulfuric acid which will come down as acid rain which can impact plot life goals deforestation it needs to corrosion of building materials this kind of thing and  so its proven to have a detrimental impact on on health and itself whats the I am  suggesting have the moments  the armor was imposed limits on silver content of fuel of three and a half percent from the first to generate twenty twenty they will reduce this limits to zero point five percent so thats a really big drop is it going to be at his to internationally because yes its the I. ammo the international maritime organization but on some of the countries like China just a pop punk one at random that hasnt had a brilliant reputation around  pollution Im available , they are my yes and Im expecting enforcements levels to be relatively high so I believe now that it will be up to the ports for states to enforce these rules of ships that are not complying with the rules and wont be able to talk with ports and also theres a question mark over whether the insurance they ships will hold if the norths complying with the regulation so I think thats important levels will be high okay pull , whiny to ships use this fuel is is so horrific Klay policing it really is but dirty secrets the thats when you get a barrel of oil has to go through a refinery and the refinery produces a bunch of stuff that we consumers can use so it could be gasoline or petrol recorded in Europe could be diesel then there are some perks that no one really wants so high sulfur fuel oil  H. as if I was it cold is one of these products that comes out of refinery that no one really wants and sludgy its dirty sludgy sound or its its its no see so on the list of on one two things its kind of that with ash felt as well comes on a refinery in and goes on roads so its a product that no one really wants it makes you see it so cheap in fact that if you took a barrel of oil and could be readily converted into a barrel of high so if you will its you lose money it is good a negative profit margin so its its very undesirable and as a result its used in places is that no ones going to complain about it saying the other sort of arresting style that is the in petrol the sulfur content is twenty parts per million in this high sulfur fuel  marine oil its thirty five thousand parts per million Sir its nosti its horrible at the moment its used in the middle of the Pacific and the Atlantic when no ones going to complain , to be regulated name Im how with the shipping companies going have to adapt to this so  UP I presume a much lower level of  of cell phone in the  in the fuel are they going to use a different view or change the ships in the same way that for because when unleaded fuel with pro in the engines changed just wasnt numbers around this I mean the marine industry uses around three million barrels a day of high sulfur fuel oil so you there are number of choices the easiest one is they could cheat are they can completely ignore the rolls ankle can you burning this high sulfur fuel oil then the risk of of sanction and fines I think what most of them will do is just switch to diesel which is a low sulfur fuel  the other choice that they could have is to install scrub on the vessel that basically takes the nasties out of this myself a few little issues is that what is being spent its its its taking the exhaust is that right yes I believe it is off to the  once is burned and and I mean that thats a very perfect solution as well because often what tends to happen is the sulfur just gets dropped in the nation  so its not a complete solution to the problem it just kind of means you can take the box and say we comply with the rules it said just to reach great then youve taken all of the exhaust fumes so its not going up into the sky is Jonathan was going about some acid rain but but you by posting that step and just putting it straight back into the ocean where presumably a whole load of  self sofa doesnt really help things yeah I mean theyre differ type solve technology so you can have closed loop and openly describing say it depends what kind of keep you got on the vessel but I think I think the reality is is that most shipowners you do once and hapax ideally and so you you need to your question marks at the moment in terms of the exact timing are they gonna be waivers for some  country some shipowners I think all this uncertainty is sort of leading a number shipowners to kind of hold back and say well look you let when do we get that I dont know point investing in a particular type of scrubbing there if we dont know whether thats that rule is still going to hold in a couple of years hence correct yeah and and I think what a lot of people doing is theyre looking at the cost what is the cost of buying the more expensive diesel versus spending many millions of dollars on a scrubber on the vessel I think it it at the moment were in a situation whereby you know yes there is some investment being announced but lots of people gonna holding back as well and and Jonathan Im whats he sing in terms of the behavior if the  the shipping companies so so I agree with Paul so I think the vast majority of shipping company so far of  indicated that they will go down the route of burning low sulfur fuel , foot for exactly the reasons that that did pull mentioned in a this was a big upfront topics cost for installing a scrubber whats props the most interesting aspect of the scrubber is actually if you do in school told us cover the economics of doing so can actually be quite compelling in terms of the cost so for sample file accords accompli that I cover called CMA CGM so they they bones of eight million tons of fuel per year which is about sixteen thousand tons per year if you multiply that by the the price differential between high and low sulfur fuel that comes to four million dollars which is in a roughly average cost of a scrub SO installing a scrub a kind of see how very very short pay back period on your investment if you ought to go down that route  I think the reason the pull mentioned why companies are props little bit resting to do that  are definitely valid but status on my view is that suddenly for the first movies in the and adopting scrubbers that could be  quite nice returns to be made either way theres going to be more costs for the shipping companies only that theyre going to be paying more for more expensive fuel for that going to have to Im  impacts in ink in terms of a cap ex this sort of thing rarely stops with the opening this investing a guest post on somewhere ultimately to people like you and me its all Ive seen estimates estimates of costs in the region of forty sixty billion dollars a year for the shipping companies of complying with these new regulations so youre absolutely right the cost is forty two sixty billion thats right so it was an enormous amounts when you consider that the operating margins of shipping companies warty very low the fuel costs all round fifteen percent of their operating costs of you increasing those costs by fifty percent and thats going to mean that the shipping come these probabilities no longer sustainable right Sir but it is happening to the industry as a whole then presumably they can old for exact prices out so  the mobile what shipping companies will try to do is to pass on the additional cost in full to their customers which is that we know impact margins history suggests that its very difficult for them to do that so I wouldnt expect it to be a full Paul through box , have to be a substantial cost through otherwise the shipping companies are not gonna be making any money and therefore not going to provide the service okay underwater which is Christ I I went make anymore Im AT references like that sorry Im the pool if they do with these shipping companies do old switch to  to diesel and it say in a quite a significant proportion of the market what impact would that have on the prices if diesel the marine industry uses around three million barrels a day of high sulfur fuel my guesstimate sees that all of that about two million barrels a day switches to diesel the rest will be a combination of non compliance scrubbers  you could do some mixing with , very low sulfur fuel to get compliance youll see about two million barrels a day incremental diesel Dimond not to put that into perspective the global diesel markets at the moment is around a twenty eight million barrels a day market so a two million up it is quite meaningful represents around following vis along the line growth coming what once , now we have these things go forward cuts and see what you can do is you can look at the forward curve all of the so called diesel crack in the crack just means the mall engine to be made  if you could give us a barrel of oil into a barrel of product and if you look at the food because this suggests that theres going to be around a five dollar per barrel up lifting the diesel cracks are roughly from around twenty dollars a barrel to around twenty five dollars a barrel so thats really again Quincy significance its quite meaningful this is a flip side to this as well because you also go to high sulfur fuel crack as well and if you look at the food because of that it shows the the cost of a barrel of high sulfur fuel oil flowing by around five it was about okay what we will come to us in in a minute but just again to give me a little bit of context around the impacts on other industries is it fair to say that given all the I mentioned  diesel because at the  at the top of this post Cold is it fair to say that as a time when Dimond from them might be folding this is one way that  diesel prices could be kept Hana , yeah I mean this this shoot results in higher diesel prices there is a debate to round how long will they stay high because you the the the old saying goes that you the queue for high prices high prices on  what tends to happen over time is that when pricing signals of that more the disciplines respond to those pricing increases so you , the diesel price stays high for a long time youre gonna see more shippers install scrubbers youll see in a some commercial and land transportation might shift to other forms in it my my my my shift for example a BA should result in high diesel costs interesting okay and presumably theyre all going to be some winners in an order this is not just the  the scrub I make is Id love to have that my business card but Im the refineries who  adapting to the different needs so Im how  companies positions for for this change is coming down refine is live in a world of very small margins you Bonnie the crude you put it through was essentially a very complex thoughts and you end up with different types of products coming out of it could be gasoline diesel high sulfur fuel Ashbel whatever and so you I kind of regard this new regulation is kinda loping a great big break in the palms as it were and there will be winners losers on the  on their fine refinery side of things so if you a very simple refiner  without much complexity in your refinery you might produce quite a lot of high sulfur fuel oil I know stuck you come today it takes a long time to react  because you have to spend money on capixaba you might have to install expensive capital equipment and at the moment in companies that want to do that search your simple refined  and out of your product stream you produce quality high sulfur fuel oil youre going to be in that Louisa but then you got some complex refiners with all the bells and whistles and the refineries and they can basically take any time for crude and convert into any type of product and typically those refer minor is  or in the US and so you if youre a complex refined on the Gulf coast in the U. S. what you can actually do is you come by the discounted high sulfur fuel oil substitute that for some heavy crude youre getting from from Canada put a few complex refinery and turn it into diesel that you can then gets a much higher price for so for example the most exposed refinery in the U. S. is a company called Valero consensus for costs around six billion of it offer them this year I cant believe that the  Im a benefit for them in twenty twenty is around four billion seven other two thirds on on top now it says I quite a big shift for for both of these industries the that the shipping and  the  the oil companies as a  supplying them but when you have any form of big change to a Im a pass in I am a model that has worked for decades he gets unintended consequences Sir can I ask you both to perhaps coast Yeomans Ford to think what might be the unintended consequences of the sort of change so one unexpected consequence is the thats it was this high sulfur fuel going to go to its not just going to disappear certainly the night too cheap to cheap Im what you will see happen is it will become cheap enough that it can compete in the pouch and markets you got a big power generator , complex instead of putting coal or natural gas into that or indeed all youll youll say this hi so fueled really cheap you know Im gonna burn that instead and so for example in the Middle East in Saudi in particular I believe them making investments so that they can re toss that power gin industry so it can burn high sulfur fuel oil the net result is going to be that all the high sulfur emissions of in the middle of the Pacific and the Atlantic unknown get about a now going to be over land and over populated areas and then perhaps there would be some regulation in ten to fifteen years time which should start to look at that again but its  its the oil according to what camel we my edit that set but its exactly that but but but for the packaging industry that is not a globally regulated industry and so you if you know middle eastern governments wants to burn a particular type of fuel theres no one there to tell me dont do it and okay and Johnson was about you  anything anything that you can think of where this might start to distort things in future from my perspective I think the impact is going to be felt  with the end consumer so it is going to see hi price is a result of this some people have suggested that VS could result in a global economic recession because you could you be make everything needs to get transported globally everything we consume gets transported so you diesel prices go from twenty to twenty five dollars a barrel in in terms of the crack thats why diesel prices theres an all given the says also you want to refine his will then do is they lingered Max distillate which means theyll trying produces much these was a candy so that means its going less gasoline so you could see the gasoline prices go up as well so you some people suggest that this could result in , Hyrule prices hi diesel prices high petrol prices and looks old grind much lower than they were before yeah how likely is that in your estimation well I think its I think its unlikely as a standalone event to result in a global economic downturn but in an environment where you need the fed is tightening and weve got plenty of things creating instability exactly this sort of well intentioned environmental decision in it could result in high I we will result in higher interest rates higher inflation you sound slightly skeptical if you dont let me say what would you suggested was an alternative approach if if not start right to this well ,  president trump for example has indicated just last week that he would like a phased , roll out of these regulations and I think thats online Klay , because as soon as you indicate theres some kind of a phased rollout then companies will make the investments  but in if there was a phase rollout server three for you is then you know youre not going to see such significant moves in diesel prices gasoline prices without that really is quite  sobering to think about is the yet that the broader economic impact I always like to because with the end of this post because to think of something positive other any positive surprises dont even the shipping sector itself I think that could be a medium temples give  outcome here so first of all this is a reasonable chance that these new regulations for some older less fuel efficient ships  to be scrapped because theyll be  longer economically viable in terms of returns of theyll make so that over the medium term should lead to a higher level of scrapping in industry which should help with the supply demand balance all of available capacity should supports freight rates in the medium term its also likely thats whats chips shipping companies tend to do in fuel prices rise is they would use the speed of the ships because that makes them more fuel efficient its what we call slow steaming so this not only helped to fuel efficiency but also increases the the journey time that it takes the ships go from portables in occupied for longer than we see how the how the decreasing effects on available customers again should support  freight right so for the shipping sector although Im expecting hi fuel cost in in the near term impacts margins over the medium term it should help support freight rates has been one of the problems faced so not just a major upheaval for the two industries that we focused on but for every consumer in the world with the risk of perhaps triggering a recession that said lets hope it doesnt I will thank you both very

11,12,"Lou and welcome to a new series from fidelity international where we tap the brains of our analysts to learn about the industries and businesses you are investing in , has the when it today right Im youll go is it a directed a lady and I met the smart these expo in Hong Kong a tech treat there where you can see everything from the latest in automation to what the internet of things will touch next and of course theres the latest in mole biotechnology almost and smart phones went mainstream some ten years ago theres been talk about what she the next generation of personal technology will take thats known as the form factor mostly what weve had along the way or incremental advances as to the now ubiquitous leak rectangular design of that smart phone in your pocket or purse but recent advances in material technology could be about to change all that in fact our analysts think were about to witness the biggest step change in mobile phones since the dawn of the iPhone about a decade ago , the other obvious thing that any visitor to this trade show will notice is the abundance of Chinese technology companies Chinas tech sector had earned its something of a reputation in the past decade as a builder of technology mostly developed by others copy cat rather than a leader but again thats also changing China is now positioned itself as a formidable player on the world stage not just in mobile hardware and communications but in a range of associated technologies even in smart phones Chinese companies are now jostling to overtake firms like apple and Samsung for domination of the global market place so a new generation in mobile communications and a new leader of the technology what could all this mean for consumers manufacturers app developers content providers and investors I asked our analysts the ground in Asia listen on to find out , with me in the studio here in Hong Kong is casing it clean and equity analyst covering tech card  semi conductors in the smartphone supply chain across Asia and Peter Carter an equity analyst to also focuses on tech hardware and industrial automation in greater China welcome to both of you , Casey lets start with the mobile phones themselves was and this step change or form factor shifted  I mentioned in in the intro whats happening here where once my friends have been an unprecedented success in the decade or so since it relates billions of and sold and penetration rights gladly have risen quite sharply probably quicker than most people expected , and yeah youve reached a point now where a what was once a noble innovation is now become pretty pedestrian at a mature market things like increasing the memory size or  adding some new features like face ID havent been enough to get people off their lounges said recently view since Sam sung developed the first real form factor change in a long time with the release of their foldable smartphone still folding mobile phones are entirely a new idea I mean weve had clam shells or flip phones that have been around for a long long time so tell me what exactly is new and different with these wide six if you can do is that  smartphones become very powerful in fact  the off and now is as powerful as as some of the mac books but the form factor itself limits its usefulness theres only so much you can do with a small touch screen where is it S. FO double five and is considered the best of both worlds when its folded you have a  a normal smartphone and that you can use and and has all the benefits of portability but when its on coated lockable you get a far larger screen its about three quarters the size of an I. pad which means you can operate multiple apps at once much like a laptop or desktop you could also Pepsis functionality like a pen and  if you would to pair it with a portable keyboard it it can replace many of the functions that were performed on a laptop yes Sir I I guess in the last few years we sing yeah constant Grayson in screen sizes thats the rise of phablets and I think of this at the end of twenty seventeen and the average screen size without Flughafen ages and you know your thoughts and gets the issue of usability say your ability to use your finding anyone hands  and some people are defined fob Kwan will they say the idea is that if you can have the usability of a small fine and then  say the screen size logic for into any game will use videos then you get you know the old benefits of the of your tablets with the functionality of a small often Casey have there been any like specific in a logical advances that have enabled the us to get the point of having folding phones or whats changed its pave the way for this yeah the the key technology advancement is what sense on coal infinity flex display now he says this is there  led display technology with a variety of materials which means that the screen and the find itself can fold many hundreds of thousands of times this skeptic in me is going to wonder is this not just kind of another gimmick or something that might really come a struggle to gain traction I mean Im thinking back to things like Google glass the original Google glass and how that never really kinda caught on in DC this is is being a bit of a flash in the pan or is this really the the paradigm shift the game changer I think given its and its more of like a an evolution an existing technologies its kind of by sea bring your tablet and your smart and got it to you to process a very successful in their own rights where as you know things like Google also some funny things a solving something with potentially inferior technology or someone who isnt right yet or maybe a form factor that isnt very user friendly so I think it genuinely meat sickens human need that is out of that and is desirable youve used genuinely seen people want the biggest greens and weve kind of got to you you get the maximum you can get with just one rigid screen say I I think in January meets the needs and and its unlikely to be just a function of time Casey would you agree with that or yeah I think Google glass was with solution waiting for a problem but  the photo  smart phone does meet some genuine aids having said that I dont think that change happens quickly in the IT industry  and I dont think the foldable any different if you look at laptops for assistance it took two decades before laptops overtook desktops and I think at a price point which is likely to be fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars the sky  initially will be pretty small  Sam song is expecting about a million units to be sold in in two thousand and nine ten  and I think once they collect all the feedback on the hardware the user experience and how that tap is with the operating system theyll go for more of a full scale launching into twenty and beyond and most expect all of the marriage  smart find supplies to have at least one model in the market  by the end of if twenty nine ten with the exception of apple is probably going to be  slightly behind that schedule Casey who are likely to be the winners from this shift them within the smartphone Nico system  now that youve reached a reason they mature state the market will begin to consolidate you still have about a quarter of small find sold by the other places which  those other than apple Sam song and the four major Chinese supplies why why show me a PO in favor I expect their market share to shrink drastically and the market to be consolidated between the the the six big prize , but I think the real impact of foldable finds is as a general rule big screens main speaks Dada and says it is a direct correlation between this because of the screen and the man of Dada consumed so in the first half of two thousand and eighteen , users with the screen size greater than five and a half inches consumed fifty percent more died in those with the smallest grain under full point said in inches and I think the the advent of affordable smartphones will only accelerate these trends is is this more use of a video related applications things like you chewed Netflix and even video calls like Scott it also extends the usability even further into gaming thing given rating of ebooks becomes  be easier and better to use on on affordable fire and and then down is even the potential  substitute ability with tops very bullish potentially for telecom operators I was a yeah thats right  I think  telcos will benefit from the the gray to dot a usage and theres also an interesting statistic that apple  told us that to is almost a new perfect correlation between the price of a smart phone and the amount of daughter with the amount of services that use it consumes that would be a benefit to toca is and and you know were talking a lot also about the shift from four G. the five G. how important is that to enabling this kind of form factor shift with with smart phones or is it a separate  development I guess this is the big question about whether network operates to benefit as well as whether they can monetize the shift five G. say  theres been a lot of course and us to eat what the use cases offer five G. one definite thing is the continued need for more days especially in  than dense areas say you know in in capital cities especially in transit hubs is already struggling with with data bandwidth and yet photo finds except your various other things consumer usage of days that will increase and in terms of the benefits trees from that side of things  you know he looks he got the rise of the of the  Chinese network equipment vendors like wall way themselves and said see especially buses the incumbent sieve Ericsson and Nokia and theyll be quite interesting trend for , what do you make of this in terms is this Chinas moment than in the the prominent role that kind of Chinese smartphone please but also further down the supply chain are going to play in this is this is a moment where theyre gonna kind of assume a greater leadership role in the industry yeah I think smart phones has been a a remarkable success for the Chinese industry  I think generally people ever got it Donna technology China the companies related to all things technologies being copycats but I think in the smartphone industry is theyve assumed a genuine leadership position  and a lot of thats to do with that they much pasta design cycle if you look at the locks of Apolo Sam sung they flagships are released annually where is the Chinese place have even six months design cycles and a means theyve been now would it be alright with with new features any many cases of being first to market with with some features such as the full screen  bezel list displays pop up cameras jul or triple cameras as well when and under display fingerprints and so I think within within the landscape qual why has really been the the largest beneficiary and I think a large part of this success is due to the in house technology that theyve developed the key pot being the IP the application process of which is the brains of the smart fun and if you look at the smartphone industry there is only three brands with their own I pay being Sam sung apple and far away and these three companies have commanded a huge proportion of the industrys profits and I dont think thats any coincidence so I think what ways is a formidable competitor in the market  and its viewed that way by its peas apple and Samsung and I would not be surprised to see them soon the number one global market share at some point in the future well so I did buy hi there  they multi brand strategy today using in various markets but it also highlight on the show me which is which is another unique story within the the Chinese  it co system , it was a company that was uninformed in in twenty ten but is already risen to be the fourth or fifth largest supply globally and and I have a slightly differentiated strategy in that  the tagline is that a cell amazing products at fair prices so essentially you can buy an I phone like product at half the price the Walmart of iPhones if you will  the Walmart of smartphones if you will yeah yeah in in some respects and I mean they they business model was not based on generating profits from the hard way from the smart phones that they they plan is to gain profits from the internet services and make a system that they develop around their hardware so many ways you can see that the hard way being the profits that they generate from that is sort of a customer acquisition cost to get uses on to their their internet eco system and so in terms of internet economics is a real benefit there the drawback of the limitation of the model is the potentially your user base of the internet services is limited to the iron is of of of the hardware , but thats it thats an innovative model when I do consider it expect them to guy and try to market ship Ive seen in China  and globally Peter what are you seeing I mean would you agree this is is this Chinas moment or is is that kind of overstating the current situation is far I think that its not necessary may I mean its like a gradual shift theyve been very open about the fun they want to move up the technology calves as a number of Chinese companies across supply chain that starts to challenge historically areas where maybe time Annies or Japanese companies were leading  penetrates into the highland supplies they beat out you know changing  film  lands tech  even not be AB who do the displays  challenging the Taiwanese Karan and and Japanese display manufactures say I think its been a gradual shift but quite constant in terms of China improving the technology and we will see mention hallway  there of see one of the leading companies across number of us because , from the RP I think more broadly theres been a bit of a sea change in the Chinese technology landscape I think when youre developing new technology theres theres a trade off between innovation and and return on investment and , historically the US companies have focused on innovation disruptive innovation in particular and havent really taken a a great view of the revenue will profit generating ability of a disruptive technology at least the Newton where is Chinese development have been firmly focused on revenue the here and the now of of revenue but I think the vision is slightly shifting to a longer term vision  and you can see this in the its evidenced in  do out of our indie theyre spending now which is a long term investment  theyve now become the second largest Spender in our in Dade all is overtaking the a year and just behind  the U. S. actually account for about twenty percent of global and and he its its evidence himself in in output they had their man of research pipe is has also risen to second globally again behind the U. S. with a lot of that actually be focused on the computer sciences and and and the engineering , say even say that that is being  translated into real world into into companies  China is making the pushing to to memory which is a key component in in basically Ole I. T. devices and theyve all so I made a fairly large leaps in in the foundry operations and making huge strides in I art which is these impart melting the software with the hardware and and on that industry in particular beings its a nice in industry there on on level picking with the U. S. and and have potential to be the the global later in time Peter what is it what does it mean for you if China is emerging as a global leader you know across not just smart phones but tech more broadly read is that whats happening here yeah I guess suit in terms of some of networking equipment and not supply chain you forty seen all lands AT T. in three G. and four G. pretty much caught up by the end of forty cycle and in five G. Dale spending significant amount of money I think well right now they dont release numbers  but you can roughly back it out and I spend just as much as Nokia and Ericsson combined  spot seven billion dollars in twenty seventeen say and I like to easily Ive heard that they all very much of the leading edge of five G. technology this time say  if they go up by pecan passive I also cost impassive offering then in theory they could take a significant amount multi check lately if allowed see given that the national security concerns I am a missile see fees three China into this into supply chains thats probably more like lies ation coming in terms can the one source as lately as they can wear that technologies available and and theres very as companies downs points and could benefit from that but thats the fly in the ointment there isnt a Peter that series of international security concerns are seeing at the moment about technology thats made in China do you expect to see more the same does it for me to rise and concerns  especially from the US and Europe  and some of the countries  I guess on the network equipment side because its so sensitive as some sort of information secure information trying to these networks whether its from government so corporates so the very much concerned about  potential  spying except her from these companies I think is that T. especially given its finds eccentric people might be a little bit more concerns  but while I already how significant moksha in Europe they basically came along with forging and sniffed my mug shot through a low cost offering theyve tried as best they can to use of this wage concerns those of see any so much they can do you  and also see like a risk for them but I think from a telecoms provide expected as well you need these are very expensive things to build out telecoms networks and if someone can offer you the same potentiating equipment , twenty thirty percent discount to the your local offers offerings then its a very compelling off ring and Im sure that would take Nash was courteous and very seriously but it would definitely something it will be a come up to me too I think Casey how you see things going on , I think security concerns and tried wars generally  increasing in their veracity in recent times and I dont expect them to ways anytime soon but  I would highlight that to you China in itself is a huge potential market  and a lot of the the newer technologies are being developed at time with the benefit all a a one point three billion population  who are internet savvy and they also have huge support from the government which is to the the chagrin of of US and some of the western governments but they also have the benefit of a of a massive work force of engine is in fact I have about five times the graduates that the US has every year sorry I I expect the development of the Chinese industry to continue to regard list of security fees or trade wars and the government seizes as a as a real necessity for the economic development longer term into that point I was speaking to a as a senior manager one of the  Chinese technology company to say and they mentioned that they think in their opinion and by twenty twenty five with the of the global flood users will be in China say even if they are restricted from some of these markets thats still a huge amount of money available for them in domestic and regional they can definitely prosper without some of the small so great but so at home if not abroad for the entire Chinese smartphone industry and the up and comers within it and that shiny rectangle in your pocket or your purse could look very different very soon thank you Casey and Peter from the fidelity studios in Hong Kong thanks listening and goodbye , this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part cost is vied for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest father in pourtant eagle nices presale website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "

K. youre not tempted by the fact that things are bargain basement cheap no and a and and eat it things are at a price for a reason and to our mind almost every day in hopes that she probably every hour every minute something happens that when I was expecting and the idea that we come out small the market and that garment which is driven much more by politics than economics of fundamentals just seems naive and answer to take a position on the U. K. is to say we know more about praxis what might happen that we do that then  and then Ill pay as one else in the market and I dont think anyone has the edge what else when a few of his head  bill tell me this is Terry with you if you up at the U. K. for stocks no Im Im one of those naive fools who who thinks that said the U. case has something to offer the moment I E. of death that to a the fall mission of the U. K. is unusually depressed  a one a ship to the UK similarly unusually depressed and we kind of know why both those says situations , view Im in terms of the make up from the market  it theres a lot of exposure in the U. K. thats actually nothing to do with the U. K. and nothing to do with that of the UK economy some people estimate as much as eighty percent of revenues in the fifty one hundred arise outside the U. K.  but the the the current the brexit discount process so I think that adding a bit  for U. K. exposure in the midst of all this on Santee is actually quite sensible Roland naive and both of you up hiring had blown into this unsent risk is back on the table gyms yes I think the risk is back on the table I think I think what weve seen is is your appeared volatility which as we expected throws up some buying opportunities but equally Im a time at which you you it purely being neutral just doesnt feel active enough to take advantage of the options hes the repairing Im whether or not you agree on the two different U. K. stances its right to have an opinion right to be doing something right well lets move now to Anna and gets the macro perspective doesnt make sense that he got James and bill  risk back colon when the headline certainly of full of warnings of impending recessions well certainly headlines some awful of those who warnings and if you read this things you think well right intercession  assessment is its certainly a justifiable to have those war is because we have had the largest economy in the world the US set to slow as we enter the twenty nineteen and the fact of the fiscal stimulus fade and  when winter tightening bites fellow that we have China the second largest economy slowing with no signs of civilization for now and no signs of big old style stimulus that could potentially engineer I rebound and growth and did our leading indicator which is a global which looks at the number of global metrics also shows that  global growth is likely to continue slowing over the next two to three months so all all these seven does need to slow down I suggest only from  from a participants here , however okay thats a big however if you look at the big picture you you look at the fundamentals its relatively clear will at least to me that we I in the late cycle but he could in the U. S. and there are certain assigned said in the cyclical in the interest rate sensitive sectors and suddenly alright to sometimes tends to signs in the labor market that says things are cooling down a little bit but they slayed cycle the not make can play out for a while well also have actually lots of points to support of from central banks that and to some fiscal policy in certain parts of the world as supporting growth already to support both in the case of for downturns  so actually  I think when all said heading into recession of the next twelve months or even beyond  but of course it dates its rights to be watered down to continuously assess the risk because the Ross some into Haitians on if you look at that the youll kind of which is flat at the moment in fact there is some   Mrs between the the say that that the two in the five year  bones where its actually already invested thats you know if if if it moves between teasing tends than that it would be an indicator that most people would say  suggests is going to be a recession well yeah historical led the yield curve has been that a good indicator for recession send a lot of research has been done on this  and actually the fads some of the the feds have the models have session with those that are purely based in this indicator however theres also an argument that reflects small market expectations rather than actual fundamental so investors are expecting gold to sell but that potential expecting recession but it doesnt mean that the recession is coming in it might come because of other reasons I certainly you have some now flat and some parts are invited but again its not assigned to oz at least thats the a and M. intercession this coming not yet built what what about your view on that see if at times over the post you youve been rather more wary than most so  as you look its  into cases like that the youll have to you taking comfort from his words I am Ive got a particular perspective on I have as you rightly say are being more cautious this year , and the the data has largely going my way  things have have slowed and deteriorated and and I think its interesting we now have a a you will cuffs the list is telling us recessions coming the federal reserve or of a lamp to to the to these dangers  and I I know that theyve already moved there read the stance a bit in in that direction file of deflation us in the in the the signals that theyve been giving indeed just the the the common tree thats a company , the pronouncements an I. E. I find myself wondering if  with the Yukon flat and with that as all business surveys indicating that the business community is not quite confident to fall some of messages from  me just see your sorry if we might see a father move in that direction all four of deficiency and with markets humming discounted a lot about using prices down that could be quite helpful in in the short run yes there are there moments in time where things look bad the policy changes and told me that lightens the mood or even the tone of a policy changes and it suddenly feels Im an awful lot better than it might actually be well I I dont think that we need to see a recall for the market to behave as though re expectations of combat if the guidance for two thousand nineteen  includes  and alluring the dolls this is the famous dogs then the market might interpret that as effectively a reduction in interest rates but to me this construction he as you look at certain things like  unemployment for example in in the states which  it seems to be picking up again Im couldnt actually been we we recording this in the middle of  December were waiting for the last meeting of the FOMC this year is it possible that term I James in the computer is it possible that the feds might push off  the hike that everyones thinking will come my best guess I must use because its not about that that is not on the cards  its overseas possible and its possible I think its very unlikely I think the the the the new ones of the wording in the tone of anything they say post meeting very important and I think but by thing action itself in terms of polls is is at twenty nineteen question on twenty eighteen question so if no great shocks from  the fade with the U. S. Im than Anna where else would we be looking at for  for it so if the danger signs I think  in terms of the cyclical picture there are more warning signs in your area its too late is most definitely going to be in recession over the next few quarters and activity in Germany has been there have been a destructive  by some policy changes in the auto sector  and those destruction said seem to be long lasting or and also  some trade tensions and to all those issues in terms of external environment and they will have hovels affected the European data so I think we to watch very carefully and if were worried about your session this is why we should be looking on the US next year and what about housing because it seems a housing  property generally his being at the roots of many  a problem in the past a sense any sooner to Jennifer well this is just general looking at the global imbalances and thinking and where should do we focus on  is suddenly this be in  a really really big Riley in house prices in the most countries most about markets outside of the US and so when we look at valuations theyre really all of the charts housing market is is always at the center its its the transmission mechanism between the real economy on the financial markets and thats why we should be looking at it  the interesting trend to over the past year and thats weve seen is that some integration in house prices  in this country is that didnt see the correction in the global national crisis and continued to  seeing the rooms in the house and look like well so this is seven a sterling is dealing Khan and the sweet in Norway all this countrys already seeing going prices on the back of a stomach pretend chill pollicis specifically targeting to achieve this cooling in the housing market this and I would they be significant enough to rock markets out with those countries well this is a war I think we are waiting to see thats within all the Intel you know the policy makers  but I think if we see another big like a big external shawl creating this country is  this amazing the housing market will so its an app propagate the chalk and exacerbate the downturn okay so , bill eyes wide open as you stride around putting your risk back on how do you do its one of the most of the areas that  that youre looking at right now as you seek to step back into the markets well Ive Ive spoke no ready by the U. K. where I bought some exposure  bought back some short positions I had to in the in the fifty to fifty so the the more domestically orientated and cheapest part of the UK stock market five I dismissed Hoosier in emerging markets and the the story there revolves around and the potential for for the tune of US Mohnish policies change and for that to be reflected in a weaker dollar  for Shia the emerging markets have faced a multitude of headwinds  the transmission of tighter policy from the fed around the world his his head halt  and thats been a company by the strong we dont push so hard if both those headwinds  begin to abate I think Ill be very welcome  intimate in about your market so   Ive added some exposure Leah  I also had some  a short positions in US technology that I added quite good I mean at the end of summer  Ive bought back some of that but I continue to be wary of the semiconductor sector  I think there are red still  bad meaning for research for that state of the art of very particular to the industry itself  that have been well reflected didnt a EDS like Korea  but much less well reflected in the semiconductor stocks in the United States let me come to you James I thinking about it   the agency sort of talks about the overall allocations and the changes that youve just make that but where else should people be looking at the moment to think in terms of attractive places to invest for an equity perspective I think the the the thing that we always took my style for the last two months now and I should continue to think that the appeal value versus growth plan with any country is is it is prudent whatever your view on the direction of the market thinking outside of equities Im in fixed income definitely emerging market debt Stephanie Asian high yield within the the the and very definitely not investment grade I still like it was Richard valuation  if anything this inflation linked because Im worried about inflation and can doing that hedging theme but thing to commit money we cant underestimate gold there Thomson cycle at why look at golden thing maybe its just not food out of the pool fighter this is not one of them this is a time I gold as a treatment plan fill your adding in gold a yes on gold for ray Phil last couple years  its its not what brilliantly well but its a its not been a problem and  including Brandon I had no idea sailing off  but I I I think a going into two thousand nineteen I the environment could be really quite good for gold  if we see real interest rates fall see the dollar fall  if per chance we see inflation surprised to the upside I think all of those things  which suit gold very nicely okay were going to have  a few you reflections on the a this beam and then some projections for the it comes so Im and Ill start with you if I may what student most for you in twenty eighteen what was most interesting for me was that we saw I think real first taste or from whats tied to a liquidity it a global liquidity might mean  full markets it towards the  across EM but not just stem as not just that the major market assets sold off we had to crisis intervention team now had the crisis and take him it touch to the corporate debt markets the recently this autumn something that said it has said not been vulnerable  so far and I think of these  this all the symptoms of the same problem and of course we discussed all this   through the year but I really think this was the first year  when we soul very example of whats this in the photo that policy normalization holds in store for us is with came back over the next  for that thank you and Im bill what about you the good the bad the ugly of twenty eighteen , Im I think tens of my wound investment stance the goods has been on the I had the shape of it right  we start to two thousand eighteen the consensus was incredibly bullish  Europe was supposed to do a three percent year and  it was the year where ray we T. policy normalization in Europe policy normalization in Japan even and that hasnt happened this drive you two days talking about wrists on the down side  so a I a I think being a bit more cautious and a bit more circumspect  when the people were so optimistic in December and January has been its been quite good  in terms of the the band  a I he , I had a theme in the early part of the year that revolved around energy  and she was extremely good in the first half of two thousand eighteen and date the we the I implemented that view my portfolio buying US and G. equities principally was say was definitely   of a mistake on my part  its a boat almost anything else that was tied to the price of energy are done a lot better hi Im Im why was it white what do you think that you got it wrong I I think in the U. S. A. investors wearing chanted with technology and day if if theres a desire to have a lot of exposure to technology company this was a case for the first three quarters the money go to conference someones going to come from big St tools and school way energy well it was kind of excluded from peoples my list because it was something that they thought was even better where did you go to Europe could imagine markets and energy was exceptionally good very frustrating absolutely and and and James what I mean weve weve been talking about the fangs Ole yeah having way so technology ready did dominates markets in the US  but what for Houstons ice when you reflect on on two thousand they seem you know I kind of feel Richard  twenty teams here where everyone knew what was going to happen  and yet everyone reacted badly when it did so we knew we were going to see , your physical Tyson in end of Q. Q. T. Seki T. arm we knew we were going to see increased functionality as well as its use rejects the love you actually knew the fangs would would at some point stop the endless upward momentum everyone in the market need that and despite that one of those things were major issues the panic several and I I think that was that was a very interesting  registered yet I think whats whats doubly interesting as I did anyone knows whats going to happen in twenty nineteen I think those things those certainties that with that in maybe but if those but those were never to events twenty nineteen is a bit less clear Im a very interesting how the market reacts something is not expecting what when if its expecting some thats not a negative it starts panicking a great segue into M. a source for the coming year Im ana what might the unexpected surprises be the unknown unknowns  well the trump aside to we cannot predict what one hundred staff and perhaps brexit decide to  if I focus on policy or visit the journalistic Tatian is said  central banks will continue and hiking on normalizing policy very slowly maybe the federal boys but obviously there has and the tightening cycle  but always and no one expects that to might be back to you eat or someone come into place images if we do Inc ed had then to  yeah shop a slow down or even recession if if we are wrong so I think go back but if you if theyve got any ammunition left to spend the well drugs says they have a lot of tools so we believe him  so with that that is something thats an expected and and not and not the head re school post a phrase going on the fiscal policy of frowned at his side and in the you decides to unleash a big fiscal stimulus thats going to be great news for you wouldnt it just okay bill what about you will see youth thinking over as we go into twenty nineteen that might take us by surprise  maybe along the lines to to what you just heard from mine and fight I I think a , things have deteriorated enough in China that there will be more policy from China  and drags talking about done so I said I think the idea of the the this tightening in Europe as a fanciful I I do I wonder if you might be surprised  it by one I that we do get a post a response then in two thousand nineteen that to a  Titians Dimmitt sensible insurance to to do a bit more for school too , a to do a bit more monitored whatever that mixes and that that happens against the backdrop of very tight labor markets and day we eat we get some inflation , and I think I think that would be quite a big shock for markets the implications I would be profound  using government bonds to hate risk not working I have ng exposure to long duration high growth stocks in the Varna of just described not working I see a sixty forty passive portfolio dominated by a longer duration high growth US stocks and  indexed  got the bones that that could be a very very poor strategy in the environment Ive just described very disconcerting environment Im James was about you because there was an interesting story acts on  voices area Im wondering whether we were going to see  president trump and each to begin to see him fire Powell from the fed oil crashing to twenty dollars a barrel school so that could happen I kind of agree with bill that the inflation is is is October credit laws on my big concerns and I think more generally how you Zoll for the imbalances either in terms of returns to assets assistance to workers in terms of you know wealth disparity Im all of those are all unusually extreme immense isnt some point I have to come back together and and I think as you see that read balancing process  youre gonna see a lot of unexpected things in market saloon of unexpected things in policy I think that will be interesting but quite difficult position full circle to summarize that we dont yet know what a hot cakes or a hot potatoes might be actor Richard , only good well whereas if time and this is the lost rich pickings of the it would be back in January  but for now my thanks to my guests on a bill and James and thanks to you for listening have a very good break wherever you are goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part cost is provided for informational purposes only is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices please see our website right professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
13,14,"Im Richard again and this put coast is for investment professionals only with thinking about the world in twenty twenty nine how will we be investing in a decades time hot enough full costing whats going to happen tomorrow six ten years is a very long time were going to give it a go what could global markets look like for example a worldwide recession of resets the economic and corporate clocks what about the world of asset management itself I will changing tastes and technology affect the way we invest the even change the way we define investing and what about a cells how much since social norms and gender equality and other issues around obviously affects our approach is , joining me in the studio to guide us through these questions and the gist of what I hope will be the sunny uplands of twenty twenty nine  fidelitys device it management an Asian person and when when Lindroth senior credit analyst and multi drug can head of research for fixed income will Paris first of all women at looking at the world in twenty twenty nine ten years from now are you a glass half full or a glass half empty person so if were talking about the real economy  global economy Im definitely in the in the optimistic com theres quite a big conversation out there at the moment the says that without a brace of extended economic cycle where it with very late cycle is a kind of the turned I hear a lot and that there is a kind of an expectation that a recession is inevitable and the debate is ready around how deep without recession B. where as I I I look at many fact is within the the global economy and and could see that she as we look at twenty nine T. in and out she for sort of five ten years beyond that we may actually be an extended period of growth full for the real economy so that its all right then when when that may come to you you I can credit do you say this  optimistic view about it some  the economy as we as we go forward well I think the underlying drivers  when I look at the U. S. are pretty healthy  not quite so sure about Europe I think one may be , out of consensus view I have is that we could see some strong growth in the real economy but have the markets not perform quite as well over the next ten years okay and mostly how but you would be looking out for as we approach the twenty three I think the thing we need to be prepared for is what what what does the world look like an a and I will rate environment if we if we need to think about that for the longer term insert rates have quickly risen this year all that have backed off a little and from that but I think given the state of growth and given the outlook for inflation were probably going to be prepared for a lower rate environment for some period of time long enough to take a three to twenty twenty nine well its thats a long ways off so its hard to say for that long of a period but  I I do think we we might be in this sort of blissful state where we see a modest amount of growth in the in the overall economy and a reasonably low rate environment thatll thatll keep things moving along and and in a similar direction I would definitely so the challenge that view I think that there is a  you know that this this idea that we are going to sustain a kind of a low rate environment is very much the kind of the environment weve been over the last ten years its its really the direction weve been in ready in the loss of the thirty is we all classically sort of on  pad for walks a change in the environment kind of looks like and I think one of the things that could take us in that direction is if for example we soul that a tightening of monetary policy actually cools the economy to accelerate and the question is how could that happen that seems a very so the counter intuitive , back to but effectively I think that whats happened is we continue the reduced the price of money is that for the velocity of money has collapsed so the multiplier fed the people think that you would bring in Cup by sort of increasing the the sauce stock of money has not been that so perversely you get to a point where you increase taxes so much about you people that a low propensity to sort of pay taxes so you have this almost inverse correlation start tightening on the C. policy  obviously that has opposed to knock on effect to the profitability of banks bikes prepared to lend again the multiplier effect kinda kicks in  and and in those sort of circumstances you end up with inflation that youre not really prepared for but first will you you werent a nodding along to this , well Im , and and and and you know that this is a we talk about a big picture you talk about the thirty years that have have been and as we look forward to the next ten in that big picture sense Im does that make sense what were I agree with Paris is on a a sort of one or two year view with a tightening of monetary policy I Im fully expecting as are many people in recent volatility weve already seen that in the last few months I think were in a world where that will continue  the the other side to that argument is demographics and sat with an aging population the the need for for re financing of of central bank issue ends its going to continue to keep pressure on deficits is gonna be this counter balancing effect where central banks and others are going to have to manage down the rates in order to just keep to keep the economy going in a way  to maintain in a balance between the cost of debt and the need to re finance at that because its a very distorted world isnt particularly  Ive the lost I am ten years in terms of  the money that has gone into the system pumped in that by central thanks some are arguing that we need  almost a violence disruption of the status quo rather than the slow mechanism of  demographics that youre talking about mostly but something much more violent Paris to to change the  the set that the a landscape yes and I I think that the disruptive factor that comes into play is that for a very long period of time it could be the next three or five years I think that the the the central banks will position themselves very much behind the curve  but they will come a point where if they feel that theyre not able to control the economy you end up with a kind of a some step changes but I think what we should also emphasize is that the types of things that were talking about you know if they do come to possible actually benefit lots of people in the real economy have say because for example youll get returns to labor the like of which you happen to have for the loss of ten of ten or fifteen years old so so that the equation between the return to life of us the returns to capital will be kind of Rio and so and how will that mechanism happened how what what what will be the driver for that if if you if you start to see wages go up the massive accumulation of of wealth and with the US is an is it that starts to reverse somehow I was happening , well if if it so lets lets lets talk about your starting point at the moment see looking at most economies most large blocks  whether its sort of Japan the weather is C. even here in the U. K.  the US or Europe your starting point already the employment is is is quite low so theres not a lot of slack in in in the in the system so any environment which describes the idea that kind of to mom surprises on the upside of the next kind of three to three to five years the then then the valve the news is going to be real wages okay so thats the that the people side of it when when if I turn to you you would see a compression in margins if wages are going up into these companies what would the impact be that because weve had  companies that have Jeanne sustained for a long time theyve been able to to carry arm because  this not so much in facing this cheap money keeping them going how would that change I think we will see wage inflation because of the  the lower slack  as well as just a little  pressure  in several different countries in the US for example a few years ago on the election of trump also the rise of Bernie Sanders in my mind is very much sort of you know in line with the populist fervor the populist movement on those who perhaps lost out over the last twenty to thirty years really coming back to bear on the political landscape theres a rising populism in in many many places around the rams that the world how will that again if you take this on a tenure view how do you think that much of shapes things I miss most impossible     question because its so broad and so long in in in its view but the the tectonic plates  definitely shifting on , yes absolutely but  you know in this can also happen through gradual or peaceful means so as  costs go up in labor costs do form a major part of the construct your of most companies  as as costs go up and theres more return to the way Kerrs as opposed to the shareholders as Paris has pointed out  that means that profit margins are going to go down and  I guess back to my original point I think that could also mean pressure on securities and what about I mean data primary you you will could you concern is whether these companies that that you cover it going to be able to honor the  that that so they taken on do you get more worried as you look its the , the landscape as it as it begins to change certainly anything that reduces cash flow is an issue for credits  and so from my point of view obviously would its a threats  but at the same time I think we should also recognize that  the way that access value has been allocated over the thirty years on the way more and more has gone to shareholders thats a trend that could perhaps be reversed without necessarily really damaging the underlying corporate well see picking up on on when whens comments as it does a tangent here and touch her tying in with Paris was mentioning is is that theres this underlying premise that growth is good and  you know the topic Ive been reading a little bit about recently  is a growth isnt necessarily always good and dot if you think about us if thats a fascinating concept well it isnt sitting well what about in the world of sustainable investing right in the environment and do you know the impact on our client ads were coal fired power plants are you know increasing the temperature in the world with the well we are the more we consume and well if the world exaggerates we contend that see it as our growth leads to a more you know the need for more power plants it leads to more more sort of toxic  digs at put to putting into the environment so what if we end up in a world where  its a bit conceptual where we decide that we need to reduce the amount of output Im in that that is considered good for the media its for the greater good of humanity I know its a bit its a bit pie in the sky but it is a concept out there and you could see over the X. ten years yet with pollution on the rise at this is this is a concept that will become a reality in many countries for party to express a different way of measuring  grace that perhaps is different way valuing things all together whether its acid so whether its the way this economy is some is developing yes so the weather we look at the level of organizations that we look at the level of economies we will have a much deeper sense of balance or looking at things in the round so while Ste on E. I. needed disagree that you know with with Marty that growth is is you know I I think I think we will we are likely to see you know and and Im Im will continue see sort of growth in in in the in the economy I think that that will be a much greater attenuation to the broader stakeholder within within that sort of grow so I think where were moving from is a world where we had a very singular concept of whats good growth walls it is an interesting point there is an if if we hate you , but yours is interesting Im so most if we if we using up the worlds resources I went in ten years time the the way you value essence might not be based on   profi school  whatever the the the the E. bit doll youre still gonna be the same  calculates yes I think I love my my my theory on this is that you know much more it will be but it will be based around the view of duration so if you look at the you know the the fundamental acceleration with seeing in the crate to destructive prices around so the corporate so unique I am from  forty fifty is about sort of twenty five thirty years ago too you know full cost to be fourteen year is  probably low about the time he gets twenty twenty nine then at G. the the theyll be much more attenuation to terminal value than the well be in terms of short term profits okay women I just wanted to add to  this idea that maybe our parameters and are changing maybe going forward its not going to be all about earnings per share or return on equity we are looking at other ways to value companies and attach you know long term value to them  but I think that  definitions and parameters are getting a re defined on all different fronts as well for example were rethinking GDP and questioning whether that is the right way to measure growth and sustainability and an economy , that brings us to our next topic actually which is up by its the  the disruption within asset management itself but mostly let me let me come to you do you expect that to continue well with the industry be and and twenty twenty nine in your car over in a world where fees fees are going down the data is more and more plentiful and so they need to figure out what to do with that data how we incorporated in in our analysis is is only at the velocity of that is increasing the way clients look at look at potentially investing verses the way  you know an asset manager will look at versus an asset owner I think theres a lot of different topics did suited to discuss their I mean one of the core winds that I think is near and dear to to the fixed income world is how can we continue to in bed a quantitative amid the fundamental research more and more and clearly were doing that topics like behavioral finance are are are have entered into the into the scope of thinking in the last number of years and were doing a lot of that ourselves but how do we continue to a bed that and we utilize that data how do we process it more efficiently  you know clearly will always need to meet with management teams and to  you know try to get a sense of corporate governance  that quickly brings in an E. S. G. theme to it how do we pick but pick apart data the enables us to to look at that even more more and more efficient way qualms beginning to cause a  investment at every level Im I suppose everyone will be yes it is a call to arms race what is in and you know what is quite mean right so Im not talking about macro investing here were you looking for changes in minutia about treasury rates and talking about how we can use big data how we can use artificial intelligence to drive better decision making I think with early stage isnt that right now  it weve were already in bedding and nudges into our our investment platform where perhaps were enabling analysts and portfolio managers to look at a wider range of investments just by utilizing the data better I think the more we sort of in bad that as the process the more will keep on itll be a circular a circular benefits to the whole process and you mentioned  fees how will they change and how that prison to to to to clients yeah I knew you would bring that up  more efficient and more transparent yet transparency will transparency is a given I think clients are demanding it asset owners are demanding it but you know we will have to expose our views a little bit more efficiently and and a little bit more quickly yeah I think the fee structures are are gonna be compressed in a way that we will have to just make sure that our analysts teams in our portfolio management teams are just utilizing the data the best I can just taking notes idea of transparency when when how important do you think that will be to the investors of of ten years from now I think it will be particularly important to the up and coming millennial generation  by twenty twenty nine they still wont you know form a majority of assets under management  according to the  to studies itll be something like sixteen percent but  in terms of whats important to them transparency ranks very highly to a small group still but becoming more influential indeed in fact I think their cultural impact his problem we going to be bigger than the actual assets what what Mr her because they are leading on culture and technology is changing so quickly changing the way that we relate to each other even for the older people like in this room , we are being led by the younger people and in Paris I am hello do you sing looking at the industry as a whole how do you think it might change is its  as as women saying is being led by the louder voices of people with different  views or Im in you given lots of fun ideas about on the economic side of things is changing yes Sir  I eat I have  quite a different view on thinking about the sort of the medium term prospects for the industry and and a big part of that is influenced by you know just remembering that there are very few things in the world all of markets and investments that a common structurally not she things do work in cycles I actually think that they could be a very real prospect that its we look at the industry in ten years time Im not she what weve done is rediscover the value of active investment and rediscover the body all fundamental analysis now why do I say that well I I was I was going to yeah you would say that wouldnt you well the absolutely is not as warm buffet was say never ask a barber if you need to have account , I do feel that in the last ten years and particularly in the last five years weve seen a boom in  the types of strategies that really think not about a chef or or security is being a pa ownership of a business but really as being a kind of a price that correlates with other price so thinking about things like factory investing Ole small pizza or outcome orientated investing theyre not really interested in the show as a unit of of the underlying company that theyre out she looking at sort of sheds in that unless the common behavioral kinda characteristics so in a sense that that that the sort of one step abstracted from reality and therefore if you on as I was saying earlier in an environment west some of those fundamentals are gonna change more profoundly a the next ten years then you called live in that world of extra abstraction you know most innovation in finance actually ends up kind of turning in on itself off to period of time some always wary about terms like structural like innovative like you know I mean I dont think that disruption I dont think applies to all to our industry is a kind of you know as a price without that thats thats thats quite profound thoughts and that is it will carry on as it has done yeah and when when well I mean I think  the clients needs and what theyre interested down and what they want to achieve is going to require more active management and more innovation  you know if I may use that word and in terms of how we provide that service and we think about baby boomers and you know so many of them retiring and living longer needing to save more some of them needing to work longer you know they have very specific needs that they need to have filled  and then when I think about like the two probably you know largest up and coming groups will millennials Jen acts then also women and how you know the differences and how these groups want to invest their money its going to take more active management , youve youve taken this to another area that Id like to cover as we  which is diverse team inclusion because I know that that something that your champion old that the concepts of digest inclusion is not new but the me too movement seems to have given its very much more urgency how do you think that is going to  be reflected in the asset management I think that that me too movement is going to have a very lasting impact on business in general  because what its done is sort of pulled back the curtain on power imbalances in the work place and I see this as sort of being very much  you know attached to the entire womens movement that kind of erupted in twenty seventeen with the womens March as tetra  so the way I would talk about this is not to just focus sun gender diverse city but to think about the quality of the management team and whether they are incorporating cognitive diverse city and its not so much that I go in and take a look at the board or take a look at the management team and really analyze said Fords you know diversity however you can see that when a company is really able to navigate risks well its because its got the right combination of people making the decisions theres been a lot of research done about the benefits of cognitive diverse city how they increases profit margins return on equity  generally speaking you have lower leverage I mean I mean simply put Richard I mean nothing that for any company in any industry any organization the environment is getting more complex SuccessFactors as we talked about are all getting less homogeneous and hands I think you need in any industry much more of a kind of a multi disciplinary mindset and much more conical Clinton divers to notice six eat also I think that theres a kind of a deeper recognition that given that you need to ensure that youll attaining any advantages you can with the lack of diverse T. means that youre not even mirroring the divers to hearing customers so you know you how weve got I kind of responsibility as well so I think this is going from something which is a bit like you know we talked about with with all the sustainability FAQ to see the things that have been talked about as its kind of nice to have things I think that that becoming absolutely on the mental says how it feels in the moment cussing I millions forward a decade what sort of conversation we going to be having about this than I have I wanted to tie back into something that weve weve all talked about which is transparency , you know the challenge for asset management is to to continue to attract the best talent that we can  whether that be in a  approaching gender diversity racial diversity educational diversity and transparency is only going to help their thanks and the other has to start in schools that has to start fairly early on so if we if we want to attract more females more more  people from different backgrounds and to to this industry then we will have to start start to it in a brace it within the educational system but I think the more we can open that up and show IT asset management is and then and then I think the more will be able to attract the right talent and when when if you think about it your company is and the discussions that youre having outside the camp any  as well as as as within what do you expect to be talking about its in ten years time in fact I think if we succeed we wont be talking about it anymore it will just be a given and we will be post gender post trace is ten years long enough to achieve that I think thats a little optimistic , but are looking further out  the goal is to not to need to focus so much on this because it it just is a given and briefly Paris  what do you think continuous time what sort of conversations so I think well be having a very different conversation in ten years time I think the different conversation will be less all of our people might look to doing their entire career the morning St I that there may be a greater propensity for people to do a period of time in  finance a period of time and software appear to time in media and the sort of portfolio careers which we come currently associate with sort of much more senior  people in terms of a late stage of their career they might stop much earlier and thats maybe something thats an organization that will have to equip ourselves it sounds like a very different world in some ways but some constants too so hopefully the best of bugs awaits us in twenty twenty nine Paris thank you very much indeed also to multi and when when I thank you for listening to buy , this podcast is for

14,15,"this podcast is for investment professionals I only hello and welcome to the first fidelity real estate part cost my name is Adrian Benedict investment direct and over the next twenty minutes will say well be talking through the most pressing issues facing the U. K. real estate markets whats going on hi streets and what it means in particular for all landlords press worth remembering all landlords up pops its all pension schemes that are investing in this asset class in particular , another thing well be talking about is just option and its implications in real estate is rather the two words disruption in real estate find a home together in the pool cost Ill be talking to mark young mark hes the vice chairman of Stiefel investment bank I was simply you how is the U. K. from manager here a fidelity and came Pulitzer hes our head of research , I started by asking Kim where the UK property market finds itself , well obviously people are looking at the difficult political situation in the high levels of uncertainty but I think the interesting thing is that if you look at the real estate fundamentals the market doesnt look broken at the moment say weve havent seen significant increases in unemployment and therefore we havent seen significant decreases in some office space in fact if you look at the the global takeout members for the U. K. a takeout spin above the ten year average price in the office on the logistics and industrial sector this yeah and that means that in those sectors rents have been stable in some cases about she been rising and from an investor perspective we still see plenty of dry powder  targeting European real St more broadly but London has still been a catching its fair share of thought  that capital and investors continue to look at London from a wide range of locations so you seeing big deals done by Germans Spaniards  money from South Korea room from Hong Kong during the it say the fundamentals look que que I mean thats quite a rosy picture given what we might be saying on the newspapers on the TV screens its not what you were saying else , well me okay tional side things  definitely feel run it simply comfortable yes tenants particularly for large shiny office buildings a may be being a bit more cautious about making decisions take more space on the industrial site  this continue to the mall and take cop competition for tenants for good quality units of course retail is a whole nother story which is very tough at the moment filaments to those hes issued some research recently suggesting quite significant markdowns , are we seeing any of not yet what what are you saying as it were on the High Street well I knew that the headlines from not picked up a gain some very big numbers its a mixed picture out there but generally quite negative in particular for shopping centers  owners of thing senses of finding that its very difficult to plug the holes when tenants to Pauls and its a cumulative effect so you lose some of your key foot full tenants and your main demand  also disappear observing shopping centers of probably of the three the sectors of retail warehouse shopping centers in High Street , the toughest at the moment for landlords if we look at hi street retail  were also seeing difficulties that weve got a few small  vacant units in our portfolio just being realistic about the relaxing rents and able to get some Dimond across the piece for that space I think people are being realistic about rents and not being realistic about pricing again and up at the end of the year Im looking for into two thousand nineteen with some really big valuation falls to come retail warehouse I would say is , mix to depending on your location so you need to really be focused on the centers where the trends to trading better so youve already talked about tendency affordability in hand stops ready what youre getting into driving the various depending upon the shopping centers will perhaps cheaper places where they operate searches retail warehouses can you elaborate a little bit more intimidating lets imagine youve got capital to to put to work K. the next six to twelve months the headlines the quite negative Evans thinking almost about catching a falling knife , if you are forced to where would you put your money into the retail space , if I was whos to offend only would be focusing on the retail warehouse set to put looking  perhaps at those locations where the rents in the region of twenty twenty five pounds of folk role than significantly higher from that because think that still affordable space retailers and it works very well for the particular click and collect the mall given your perspective looking at things for much more from the set with a bigger picture on the list that side of the market houses retail thing playing out in your space , will the stock market give some pretty clear indications as to what it thinks about the retail sector the moment if you look at  how different property companies are trading at the moment in terms of valuation by which the main bank small kids is a disk and two premium to the net asset value Pasha the three companies who are trading on the biggest discounts to an IV in the listed sector the moment all full retail property landlords and indeed there  shopping center landlords  captain regional trade so at a mid forty percent discount  hi missin trades on a bigger discount in that and into his trading on a sixty seven percent discount to current net asset value , of course that leads one to debate whether or not  the share prices correct or whether the net asset value against reset share prices being competitive it is only mocked and it would seem to me the stock market is saying very loudly to the valuation profession that they do note believe the valuation throughout that for shopping centers which is a retail location and said when youre building out of the fight as diverse five pool phase Im thinking of see clearly a lot of investors ical quite sizeable positions is is is simply no longer to be cool Paul to the diverse fight commercial real estate allocation rule does it is it likely to me  I think is that those two off to this really its have you been clever enough not to it and shopping centers to day , and that for enjoyed that the benefits of that pool player location on your performance but then going forward  its going to get even worse for those who who do it and  and really it anyone who can write size a portfolio  to Notre in retail is going to be in fall fall better shape of the next two years when it comes to banks mocking performance I knew this morning I was glancing say new rivers  numbers and the other that put failing to yield has drifted a little bit theres been really very very little valuation to line from from them in the last couple of years so theres a lot of pain to be had from onus of resell who had do not have really realistic valuations I think one of the challenges to Spain that  allows people of Putins the story the the best quality shopping malls the offer the the experience everyones been talking about about how that physical retail hostile for experience of going to hold up the values but I think the reality is that its going to be very difficult for the eyes  locations to  see that rent stabilized because so many retailers all seeing that profit squeezed in that full rationalizing that port five days to I need the very best store best performing Stolz which means that the rents to be affordable again picking up the thing the Alison has been focusing on  will be the ones that continue to have occupation so I think as there is some real pains come by th the prime and of the market as well as the second round of the market save perhaps than for folks almost falls folding that even lets see its played out over the next few years do you see there being any opportunities with some of this retail space as redundant mark Im I think in the short term its a huge mistake to look a retail property and say can we can we buy this on our own a good value basis the eighties on the retail within the next many many years will become good value is when the land values have fallen so far that you can buy those buildings we develop them for presidential some of the six Im looking at these things and thinking that you can inject a valley retail proposition is more of a a deck deck chat shuffling on the strategy the mom which will yield  could return to investors thats a sobering sources and that well I I disagree little bit the coals only think that the will be re tile that will still be an attractive place to shop budget that were going to create a hundred percent online shopping ever Im a people do you enjoy the retail experience but screw the right sort of experience its not gonna be a me to town with the same old boring facial is where I she takes too long to find something in a shop than you can on youll youll small phone so I think that will be the case as an as ever we always do this in the real estate market it will be over done so the will come a point where it becomes very attractive to get back and putting it back to the house and Marcus suggesting is not even started to be down there in the real estate market at what is not the next month will possibly know even next year , Alison I do I do agree that we will continue to do lots of shopping on the High Street social pens and was of a of that have made at and will it in internet retail penetration the UKs late twenties and for Ill say it again high thirties  so you youll spot on but we need to think about the value of retail property in that context of the amount of vacancy and void if supply we have two day and then there will be growing a mind to avoid and vacancy in a supply and even though there will be plenty of retailers who wish to operation a given center  they will be able to drive incredibly hard bargain said the rent so again to rattle down and down and down because market forces are gonna take them that and on that basis they can the values of shopping centers today is still fall far too high I guess thats where Im coming from but were not a million miles apart no no , I think at the end we going to come to a another thing that sort of a favorite of every one of my matches that January we end up genuinely mixed you scheme so that some of that retail will have to carry the to residential some of it will come to pass healthcare type schemes community facilities but its going to take a lot of planning also I  to support these change the peace and some I think some local authorities are already starting to see the Nate but I think that as personal floats of  requirement for Michael sorties to really understand the , those retail values off calling and that the icon rely on retail writeable values to to to support back office and that to create a sustainable community tied to a going to have to be part of this change home perhaps they might actually be some places that perhaps less grim than the retail High Street  Im looking on getting slightly quizzical faces I have to say about safety I was where all you saying value just now in the U. K. market you touched on logistics industrial well yeah also missing where Im seeing rental grace and Im seeing a valuation increases and that stays in across the board of whether its warehouse light industrial or it just sticks and  for most of the years of my career rents never moved in and the industrial sector then we had a period  back in two thousand eight two thousand nine where rents went down and since then this being a phenomenal growth in  base rental values and also valuation all of the industrial properties in industrial sector , but when the US led does to you today is that its become puff any normal to pay yields  even in the threes like fools  for industrials based on expected rental growth and here is where the market will make the same mistake because quote from makes which is treating or properties equally and really that mental growth is only going to come through how the rates expected for the very best properties so I think by picking your way through the market I think the still good value to be to be had the and  Im particularly fond of London and south east industrial markers that similar thing to what you sing in the listed market logistics commanding better pricing is certainly the companies we talked to  involved in logistics continues to be very enthusiastic about them but I would I care what I listen this saying that that theres a price for for and we may be reaching peak pricing  so as to what one needs to be careful that they they clearly the ever shrinking supply of of London   button  logistics base  it is its name which is is was tracking other areas posted there is to think about the first one I might say which might surprise if every every listen to is I see the city office market the thing with having thats going on around this one one to be no this is the city office market but  well cells right looking to space at the moment  we want something reason fifty thousand square feet and  its beginning to look like it might be a bit of a landlords market there is not much new space out that okay theres a few towers but if you do want to be in a town there are not many options so thats thats an interesting market to to think about elsewhere and its ready to be mentioned healthcare is a sector that we continue to like and thematically we typically Stiefel have liked and focused on sectors in recent years which cannot be disrupted on not disrupted by the internet healthcare assets would be one nice residential I lovely places to live is another retail is clearly not , Kim few any thoughts on the yes I think I think the theyre also going to be some big themes the  change the way that property is use you stay for the next ten to fifteen years  I think the service industry in the industrial rep the fourth industrial revolution I think is the the interesting one and how we use offices and what sort of requirements that will be for office space and whats been talked about about the we work phenomenon and and how thats revolutionizing the Im not entirely convinced the date that is we work thats important in this story but the ways we welcome the way particularly the millennial generation wants to work may mean the offices need to be used in a different way in technology needs to be brought into the way that we manage office space and occupy office space in a in a in a small sway and will change perhaps the fundamentals of what a good good office looks like  the other things that I think a big themes for the ex five to ten years all the demographic thing which again goes back to thoughts about health Catholics about housing and how thats going to change  in particular theres been a lot of talk about how millennials statement I in things anymore sigh perhaps a shift away from and ship of housing to rental rental housing and how that might change what our housing stock looks like  full food food fit for purpose rentals  so I think that they said that theres going to be big changes that perhaps influence what portfolios look like in ten years time that will be a move away from just the straight three classic retail office industrials to take in some of these changes in the way that people live and the way that people working , prince can you like to voice coming from Antony told us in his famous novel and paraphrase it to the way we work that , its not , thank you for that Im Alison just bring you own not , it came so close to us about some quite big thematic changes that are likely to be driving so far how we use our current space whether its where we live where we work and so forth but from your spectators investigators trying to deliver a realistic explosion consequently is a realistic returned thats quite profound changes because , well youve ever had to really deal with is investing in retail office and into in a previous life Id love experience in  student holes and all the type of social housing , I think it is important to remember that all job is  providing space to people he to pay a rental it was have without spaces  certainly on the in terms of the  the fourth industrial revolution  we have seen across all whole portfolio alright and tenants putting Ford proposals for fifty pounds as theyve changed as theyve matured as theyve developed by ways of working in their offices and its typically reducing the amount of space that they ones bringing in more hot tasking much more working from home I mean even for the as hes doing that now Fritz office Maeve so I think weve seen the changes happening the space requirements reducing and I think it makes a lot of sense to think about different sectors where you have to go long time income I mean your best ultimate match for something that set up pension funds in terms of investment should probably be something thats more in the residential sector , we talked about disruption talks about the re I was pretty much told her everything but barely mentioned brexit , is bricks even a concern , well Ill go first on this one because  aides say is obviously a topic where  weeks auto by saying no one knows exactly what it is yet and Im not sure whether we will next year either , I I actually think that the structural changes Sir  of the move to online retailing the chain engine the way hes working  the change in the ways we living all more important changes over the next three to five years in terms of the performance impact and above and beyond that certainly what we saw when  was the brexit vote and post stance the currency is a key driver of underlying performance of assets in the U. K. were very open to foreign investment and I use those flags are gonna be turned on and off dependent on the position the currency , yeah I I agree with Allison nothing the currency question is an important one and its not simply about brexit I think as weve seen  constitute easing on winding and you see now happening in in the US at that time surgeons in interest rates is going to stop meaning that currencies move around a lot more in that they could have a big influence on investment into the U.

15,16,"hello and welcome to the first edition in twenty nineteen of rich pickings fidelitys asset allocation put coast Im Richard again editor in chief and joined the gentle babble of the friends in outside the London Stock Exchange in contrast to invest is he being picking themselves up and dusting themselves down after the turmoil at the end of twenty eighteen in this episode we take a closer look at exactly where markets find themselves with a brief detour into the brakes it doldrums and what key the mood music is written in that failure manages around the world humming along to send me its not his discordant as you might expect listen on to find out more with me in the studio with three of the multi asset team back from the Christmas break and already up to the elbows in the market some going around the table for us to be honest its gonna head of global macro and investments trusting that and we we start with a probing personal quite Jim to intrigue a soul and Id like to know whats the most obscure foods that you have tried Im going to give you two things because  I add that to the same time during the same meal and that to us chicken faith and doc tongues most obscure in certain parts of the well but its good for us to fear okay to to get also we have a full forty minutes in the neck welcome what  ditties have you done on a fee for the one that stands out was on a trip to Vietnam many many years ago our defense a lot for five the soup and  mine is to have cow intestines nine one point sounds delicious were recording this early in the morning and I can feel my appetite rising I finally James Bateman chief investment officer of multi asset James will come to you are you a fussy eater or an adventurous one arm I I think my my innate conservatism with  investing in and through this is probably recently  similar Richard but but I would I would say that for the most interesting thing Ive eaten is is a proven brain on a bed  from aids  pool and feet from lex Im not did eat that with Nick actually in Japan once were on a business trip well I think it sends and James you are what you eat of course Sir  Im glad we got that so its its better to get this Im going the program profit at James can you tell us what positioning the group had decided for January and  what changes are being a particular of course Richard so in terms the main positioning no change on the overweight equities overweight fixed income  underweight cash within not only really one new once of change which is we have moved over weight to US equities thats reason controversial move within the team  come to that and I think you know what I would say is were not ready signed by the U. S. market for much more saying there are areas of the US market that look too attractive not to be overweight in the more value areas there is I havent really moved much of the last eighteen to twenty four months where we see upside but equally limited downside to risk on yes okay well a quick interlude then and I **** how cation discussion to bring in the ugly mess the tease brings it recording this part because the morning after the night before when prime minister Theresa may suffered an historic defeats on the deal she negotiated with the European Union but before others of comfort in her governments  this to you this evening that not an awful losses happens in markets overnight but James disease change anything or as Theresa may herself might say nothing has changed well the item to to borrow the prime ministers words or shows the current premises words that we did it we will be  later today but but but look I think in a reality everything is panned out in line with expectations there was no way this deal was going to be voted through  at this point the market is sanguine because was completely in line with expectations Im not sure the magnitude of the debate to defeat is probably irrelevant in terms of of a practicum cations I think well say the the the media Kelly left out to hype up this being the biggest parliamentary defeat in history to have a lot more MPs and therefore not to pretend the rebel than weve had in history so its not every department we got us most twenty four the mathematical analysis , when I watched it last night  being a historian are hot so is it you know Im not that perspective its in line with expectations Im actually trees a mate could the Tatum wanted a written a confidence about point so this is in line with whatever strategy we might think she has  is as old as expected Anna if I come back to the a a G. discussion that we had  this week that you hosted Im the U. K. he didnt get a mention not even once I am is it just an irrelevance in investment times until I exit has been result one way or the other I dont think so  in the sense that we have all this the focus to PLO imposed six the has since their friend to him on that the but that is what has driven markets particularly the pound but I feel very strongly about not losing sight of fundamentals  and I think from a longer term perspective and we all long term investors  I think the way to think about the out com for the U. K. that would be in terms of the so called production function war the facts  the term growth of the economy I exited the game for that suits against capital and labor but I am Nick if I come to you whos going to be putting capital into the U. K. at the moment when its a whole slew of Blair in Vegas to what what what direction the country is taking yes thats thats a very defensive very easy question to answer not many people right fonts  from an investment perspective Id argue that you kicked his look very cheap now and that she I have been adding very slowly I wouldnt miss at the a a jeep , yeah so you know exactly the same but if you look at domestically focused U. K. equity stocks  trading of single digit peas and very close to historic lows so from from my perspective thats a great place to start investing Ive got no idea whats going to happen ultimately bots well yeah come its a good its not pond is a group is to start with everything which I think that did I have I was I I always worry about investing to do an evaluation basis  because we come back to kings is in the in the long run more with that and yes it will come right but maybe too long I think I think Nick has a point here and I I think the point is that when we look the  the behavior of known U. K. outside of U. K. investors theres been virtually no purchasing a few casualties for lengthy period Im not money on the sidelines and at some point there will be a trigger that brings it back in Im not only to a a reason to shop I suspect we rating of U. K. stocks so I think youre as as a dispassionate investor the farmer in the U. K. so Mr relevant here is just passionate investor its very attractive some very attractive valued  stocks were little very attractive  stocks and you can see that its been a technical factor in terms of lack of did and for them that at some point is light to root so it does seem Im attracted to beat up the margin increasing unfashionable but perhaps a an interesting place to invest in but the debate kicks off again this afternoon off the promise of questions and then astonishingly a debate on a pro members bill which would ban post boxes from being built too close to the ground I for one will be glued to the box now beyond Briggs its  breathe a sigh of relief box if youve been looking at the data its been a pretty miserable start to the year what does twenty nineteen hold well discuss it here in the studio in a minute but first I caught up with research I missed in some some who puts together for that is hes a leading indicator , thanks for taking the time to talk to Snyder  you use the fly you figure this is leading in the case that every month and its making pretty miserable reading do you want to explain whats going on this month and just how bad it is if you look back historically , certainly well this month if that in case youre has moved even further into the bottom left of its cycle tracker which is precisely where you dont want to be it means growth heading below trends and also decelerating in fact its actually consistent with growth heading to the lowest level relative to trend since two thousand eleven two thousand twelve which  market participants will remember was not a particularly happy time and really the key driver this month if incremental at bearishness even though  across the board signals are because the real incremental drivers be in global trade data other thing wearing signs for for quite a while but really the the death now come from China over the past two months where trades days has been very weak , thats thats serious language well it could be a Oakley for death relatively short lived and let me explain why  what you saw was at a large M. front loading fictive see heads off for the proposed escalation in US China tariffs on January the first  and November was really the deadline to get your shipping out and so supply chains have been working overtime to get this trade all done in time , of course that those tires were never actually implemented but still that the panic buying in advance of course some basic things and events yes and  well at least at Tober and then you saw some pay back in November even more pay back  over the past months  now I think theres more to it than just thoughts that plea does over states the weakness at but the impact could be here for some time and theres other reasons to be negative on on both global trade over the next three to six months  but also just global ecstasy as the I would suggest so in summary I am your full cost based on  the fly basin with the data thats going in to make up that picture  is that  the beginning of twenty nineteen is going to be pretty weak yes closer still continue to soften from in some places already quite a week  place at the end of twenty eighteen any  psycho that we control from  the dates OR tool so after a very weak crown in German industrial data at the end sad the your click very chrisley in in Europe at which stars see a tentative blossoming hours  so if that continues  I would really help is that based on the moment within Europe or coming from Asia certainly the weakness earlier in the year was  as a result of Asia and emerging markets slowing in particular  but in fact the relative resilience might be results of the years of actually holding up domestically a little bit faster right back in the studio Anna it sounds and looks pretty dreadful but youll still confident that when not heading into a recession at least not yet , I think it depends what country you look adds theres a lot of great now about to at almost an imminent US recession and I think the probability of that its very is very low yes were seeing a slow down  from a very high and sustainable rates of growth to somewhere perhaps around track and to the one point eight two percent growth in the US  that but to as is the economy stupid to strong I think the consumer has the support from the sizing labor markets and  opposed to feel a just the savings rate is high and there is definitely room for just Smith on the consumer side so we seemed manufacturing slowdown in the states but youre saying its the consumer which is that makes up the bulk of the economy that is gonna keep things ticking I know consumption makes up a seven two percent the off the gross domestic product in the US so it is very important if you remember back in twenty fifteen manufacturing was essentially in recession but the quantum is still delivered positive rates of growth of the of consumer and James use you also posted on the US I know you must be you yeah just gonna alone with the team have a collective decision to the collective X. Nick for collective  and and and he did that I think I missed a couple things one is , everyone always underestimate the residents of the US economy  and the residents the US consumer snowboard I would too I think its , trump worries about the market we know that he may have taken his mind off it for a while you may have folks started focusing on other things but the reality is trump doesnt want a protracted bamaca he wants a bull market and therefore at some point something more positive is going to come out of the White House that supports markets probably and therefore you betting its too pretty major things the residence the U. S.  consumer and and trump in terms of okay direction if youre not long moment Im that trump hasnt actually achieve a lot of the things that he wants like a wall for example say you are you prepared to face something like some things are easier than others and I think the reality is for the tax cuts  his good changes yeah theres a things a massively stimulative actually he could announce them for something happening two years out that would push markets not markets your mark be positive and they could end up reversed before they actually come through so who knows but there is a lot of options on the table for him yes and thank you James thats a very positive view of of the US which brings me to Nick you will not positive in the U. S. winos white why have you stuck with a  a negative view on on on the site so to my mind is still so this is a realistic and for us and I just find markets outside of the U. S. far more attractive than the US itself the US market we will now is very expensive in terms of ratings valuation of the C. cheaper now on fifteen six in times compared to the end of last year   sort of cute through to Q. three last year but if I look at other areas such as Ive mentioned you Cape emerging markets where I may for whites the ratings have far more attractive and I was I think that  and if we have a weakening Donna thats going to be supportive for areas like  emerging markets as well so its its its its not as if I dont like the the US intelligence listening to this shouldnt take it it never hence they shouldnt take offense at his sister more transfer is also okay and it can come to Europe because that seems a bit of a risky best moments Im I mean the ECB doesnt have an awful lot of firepower left does it  no  the thats not what they wanted me to but I think  none of us would want to be in joggers shoes right now  unto you may have he doesnt have to go much longer , they have is just to  extend my answer to your question about your session that thats where I wore a I will I worry about the recession in the euro area and the risks of that a much much much higher than that in the U. S.  now its true that domestic demand is still strong and I mentioned it briefly but I think  the deterioration on the external side is still quite significant driven by the China cycle  and that is clearly showing up but in the day to particularly in Germany some of that is driven by one of foxs as such is said regulation in the auto sector  but most of which I think is due to the continuous deterioration in the external cycle that will ultimately it start spilling in to the domestic data because the one of the cross that term was discussed at the AG was  the automobile manufacturing  in in Germany and it was shocking and absolute Plymouth in line and its not just again its not just because of the changes said to regulate it is the demand from China which is really key  where does this leave the ECB as you say  not to menu options of course they can go back to the old tools  or the tested tubes QB behalf is the flow into so fab in interest rates it has not properly been tested as we can go lower billet below a minus forty basis points but I do think at some point ed they should at least thats what I think I should do rather than what what they might do Im is to put more pressure on the governments they have created the environment in which  the government said didnt really have to worry about supporting the economy so Im saying to governments  weve done a bit yeah with with with my tree policy its over to you with fiscal stimulus  that you need to take the pain for this yes exactly and dead montre policy is cyclical  but it should really work together with fiscal and together with structural policy to to better growth south coms am I and I think it now its really down to governments to do that a now at the pots that will not be smooth for sure  but I think ultimately its going to be  much more effective move from the C. B. but his course to a complex picture around the world to me not so Im not sure which way things are are getting , for sure but to get a clearer sense of hopefully manages not just here at fidelity but beyond us thinking at the moment I spoke to recall the motion he meets regularly with a wide range of fund managers in Asias emerging markets to analyze that performance and views and spotted some interesting trends , could you just summarize then the mood of the people that youve been talking to you because you know the headlines looks so miserable and yet  thats not what youve been picking up in Asia and emerging markets equities are the very merging the mood is to increase risk and  in portfolios theres in a big correction in Chinese equities in two thousand eighteen  this was a combination of and a couple of factors the strong dollar on one side and then trade wars and also most importantly and domestic slowdown in China all the region is selling to China but not none of thats changed SO looking pretty miserable  but your saying that  some of the peons are ready to take on the risk again that they sing the upside yes Regis so in order to make money in the markets investors need to distinguish what need to understand whats factor in prices so thats very important if market prices  already discounting a slow down that does it so that would be a really big in to the prices so  chances are that that we have seen the worst in that inequity prices and chances are that going forward were going to see if the musician and  an uptick some theres a time to buy these things is just not the motion when they said the margin in the direction of travel is being to increase risk so a couple of  value investors in Asia  the where or eighty over weight China for for example by you know ten percent or so they moved from ten five and they have reduced cash from seven eight down to to actually one value  investor in Asia is actually re open  his own strategy to existing investors so it because he wanted to deploy more capital because there is there is an abundance of events yes I think he is there not only the cash in the fun came down by the  sortie open the phone I mean thats quite the strong signal that tells us your post unity sent this  is good now in China and the young vessels are made Ive been out talking about you know areas downgrades earnings downgrades they see them coming but if they are in the you know between three and four percent thats rated baked into the price I think they are more in the camp of a a , yeah I mind slow down no more no more than that , a mild slowdown more than that SO pretty encouraging is that James it is Richard one of things that was interests us with active man this is is is how they use cash and Im a cynic about active managers in cash because I think they paid to be invested not not to keep money on the sidelines  but none the less  some do very that cash applications a law and its a reasonably good indicator of official to Jim term I like the market moves  in Kashmirs up and down and and you are seeing this general moves ricotta says of of cash being deployed into new ideas I know Nick talked about emerging markets a clear cut it was  emerging markets is an area we forty is a team still to have a complete consent to so much as the US you know Im at the mobile  side of of EM simply on valuation grounds and and and I think the active managers are reflecting that very effectively which is that there are a lot of stocks that a very attractively priced and almost price for a for a for a economic recession the isnt particularly to comes a muezzin in many people central KCS  you know that there is material stock level up site  which yes were not really at the end of the cycle of the moment in a Nick as a portfolio manager of portfolio managers  does what we call it a it was saying to set this up trying with hearing dis yeah absolutely  its and he said it Feb effectively it said the margin but to me terrorist a significant move away from the start  slip of investing recently last year to create great style and managers are now moving more towards looking at values startled value stocks cyclicals financials because thats why they think the next relative from relative performance will come but because the the fangs stocks the tech stocks they took a real tumble its the end of the year and that let some of the steam out of the market that was a relief rally that kicked him but I am at some point tomorrow well take a closer look at you I stay so what what happens then well I think the markets have started looking at the data and there was said of this feeling that to and the growth was stronger than that this can last for a long time and then at the end of last year  we start seeing the first signs of the soul slow down and to in particular to the latest to  Panama hi this is much of business confidence in the US for December a show did quite a significant drop and to that to spook the markets to some extent so absolutely markets already focusing on the data on on the fed of course as always and on on the shifted to a more dovish stuff recently  but ed and I do think that  there is too much via a price didnt see about recession  on that thats why I think perhaps the markets and they told a good bit of time but but the markets will realize that actually the economy is still on the relative to stronger footing at least for these very very late stage of the cycle Im sorry weve got the earnings season coming up as well so its going to be very interesting to tough tell the top down thanks to the B. capital companies the same thing , management we can forget about the results for two thousand eighteen but it falls to manage and talk about in terms of the outlook  one thing that so so I can have a significant bearing on market direction for the next few weeks could tonight okay well we are now as of time which means its time to play hot cakes and what he says what would you buy a like a hot cake what would you drop like a hot potato and let me come to official your hot cakes please I like the Japanese yen I think  the fundamental supportive for the evaluation is also supportive my most importantly it has  did the safe haven characteristics that would just be good to Ive been in there before us right now  I like that perhaps versus the US dollar am I hot potato is Sam at US treasuries  have so little bit net while control sure but they again given my view in the US and on the fads I think yields out way too little for by the economies and forbade the fads and might be in a few months time  so I would  at I would choose that as a whole thank you very much make your hot cakes are for my hot cake given Ive had to change his support Im gonna get for you K. equities  when I see  income funds a division of on this panel yielding north of seven percent that to me is a great starting point Syron thats why  okay would be annual hot potato was very much a catchy because I dont think there are too many areas your sixties aside for valves too expensive so Ive opted for the  the dollar  where models is suggesting fundamentally looks expensive and the economy is struggling and housing markets rolling Ive to use a cane and James so my whole cake  purely to rile Nick city is going to be a U. S. equities U. S. value  and Im just concerned that there is going to be a massive re rating within the US small cap even if the overall lesson PM rusty doesnt stay flat  within that you could see to twenty six percent  style deviation and that for you could actually phenomena strum a tense from value stocks traditional value stocks in this a lot of ways both passive and active to get was might be connected to get exposure that I I would think would  would be a good position that hot potato Im gonna Im gonna go to  slightly dramatically I think with German equities and and that kind of bill slightly on on my wall and it was saying but Im worried about a couple things Im worried that the  you Germany is the backbone if Europe , that Im not sheets traditionally when panic around Europe its the for free the soul of the most I think  brexit could out she white on Germany  not just practically both in terms of sentiment secondly I think the reason the reason he would do that is there a lot of headwinds facing Germany moment  and the auto use of a just this great example Im Im missing maxim and U. K. Dracula Land Rover swelled the impacts of Chinese slowdown LTO as normas I think this will be an all what through in in the German market  the tariff risk is that and as I said I think actually the market is has now the narrative that that new regulations around pollution have driven all the price sectional issues that isnt this much more fundamental to worry about that as well so so Im pretty worried about  German equities  affected by the periphery with the U. K. being on the periphery of your okay well  thank you all very much indeed were ice of time I hope thats given you listening an insight into the thinking behind this months asset allocation if youd like any more detail is published in full on our websites and if you want to discuss anything becoming just ask you for that he contact thanks very much indeed to my guess Anna Nick in recording and James and thank you for listening well be back in February but for now goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this put cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without price mission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest other important legal notices presale website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity nan"
16,17,"this put coast ease for investment professionals only welcome you learn from sixteen thousand conversations well thats how many meetings for Dennis is one hundred and sixty five analysts have had in the past year with senior management teams at companies across all sectors and all regions , in nineteen analysts serve reflects that wealth of information to create a unique view of the global corporate landscape and how we think itll fed this year with me today to talk over some of the key findings offer Dennis is director of research for equity Michael says I had to glue well head of research a fixed income Marty drop can welcome to you both thank you very much for this to be here until he could well lets start with a bit of background on what makes they serve a unique as I described it mostly Im can you can help me out here well its the night there weve been earning a survey Richard and  its its a great way that we can pull information out of our of out of our equity and fixed income analyst suit who collaborate on a normal basis but sorry we have analysts spread across Asia , the U. K. in particular and this year in fact weve introduced out we have a growing team in Toronto  as we were able to bring it weve been able to bring in the north American perspective as well what is the ads that other surveys you know macro economic data that they done well its a true its a true ball Adam up look at the world if you will  wears lots of surveys the come out of  out of banks in the sell side will take will come from a macro perspective been very the very top down theyll look at  data thats thats already out there our surveys based on analyst engagements with management teams and you mentioned the number of meetings that we do this survey is really built top from the conversations that our analysts have with his management teams and its very forward looking okay and Michael let me come to you then to ask how they form these opinions or analysts well its based on the inside that the gain from talking to the major culprits  the insight they gain from talking to that competitors to the supplies to the to distributors to private companies to industry contacts to experts is really part of the sort of mosaic of insight that we gonna from all of those different sources on which we hope to bring to bear on the investment process okay well lets get today the missive this years survey itself tell me about the overall picture the sentiment indicates to analysts arose to gauge management optimism for the year ahead thats declined this yet right across the board ending two years of steady improve what what why is that yeah I I I well I think the first thing to say is yes and sentiment house declined globally we go to recognize this is a very strong starting point in twenty eighteen which in fact was the strongest sentiment indicated weve recorded your in the lifetime of the survey Im so long way too full yes and we remain in positive territory globally in every region except China I think by sector almost every sector was down in terms of sentiment apart from health Canada selecting the traditional defensive qualities of that sector but again a lead that down most sectors remain positive terra tree the exceptions being utilities and consumer discretionary which I think were going to touch on later in the port calls we will and Im see this is an aggregate number covering credit as well as equity what is the sentiment say about the fixed income world whats your and the seven year serves as a couple of things to think about their Richard first of all fixed income analyst tend to you  approach approach companies a little bit differently theyre much more focused on cash flows so the questions are wide ranging and the same questions are asked to to every analyst whether their equity or fixed income but I think youre having balance of views brings out a little bit more depth when it comes to the balance sheet type questions Im you know I think the other the other angle of of it is  and if I can be a bit cynical about about how how fixed income analysts are cynical we tend to be a little bit skeptical about the world and so I think I think youll get that balance of inequity view in a fixed income the aim as it relates to  to the  to the overall environment okay well lets take a look its one six on its own in fact its one which has suffered one of the big S. fulls and sentiments of the consumer sector hurried wild goose hes one of our honest equities Excellency covers some of the big companies in the U. S. and tells him what she thinks is going on over the last twelve months to the key drivers of course price inflation of being labor costs and freight costs and that probably the two biggest cost items for  for retailers in general some companies have been more affected than others because of the way that a ship items around the US so you free Asian precious there from labor and freight costs says Harriet effect she she goes on later in the interview to say that is the cost of labor wages within freight the biggest burden rather than  fuel Michaela these sorts of precious on margins evident elsewhere they are I mean I think that  we are definitely seeing a pickup in wage inflation repression is around the world  a normally you would hope that these can be passed on to the comes and margins will be protected I think we are seeing some signs that a margins a starting from very very high starting point and then secondly  and and Im environment where consumers weakening as its haunted apostle this costs to the final consumer that was one of the strongest responses coming through the the seven around margins witness yes it was and  interestingly I think goals to the consumer discretionary side was one of those sectors which is suffering the biggest  reversal in sentiment  and I think you know there are a number of factors at work there thats the  and cost pressures as how you described a we could consume a particular in China  and and really the sort of head winds that the sector faces in terms of the move from High Street to on line Im a repeat if anything accelerating  an overseas more more  good to deliver it that puts upward pressure on on on phrase into recalls and most inhabit concern is not squeeze on margins from it for a credit perspective want one of the things that showed up in the survey was that job our analysts generically C. balance sheets deteriorating particularly in the U. S.  so that is a factor to to to think about and we do every day as far as that goes  you know balance sheets are still relatively strong if you look at leverage through through the cycles  over the last ten years it has increased in its back toward where  back towards where we were me approaching ten years ago pre pre global financial crisis however yeah interest rates are still low by historical standards and and yes funding costs are starting to rise which is another thing that came out of the survey but theyre starting to rise from very very low levels and so  you know that theres a less concern on the credit side as far as what this wage inflation will produce overall company balance sheets so you took my funny because being light well thats because were in a low rates  environment right at the moment because its a very benign information picture but are these the first signs that Im  inflation may will start to pick up when you start to see it in in in wage increases I mean there are some classic late cycle signals three the survey and Im sure well talk caught a lot about that one of the themes that Harry picked up on about increasing costs within the consumer sector is a pervasive theme throughout the whole survey although with wages rising presumably consumer sentiment which would rise which and said would would balance attached to it to a degree you would hope it would balance it out to degree but  that certainly not not the picture emerging from a consumer analysts  I just said that may be in part because they be in somewhat beaten down by some of the other she said in the sector yeah I I think Richard one of them one of the points to really be be concerned about is it wages are rising you would want to look to see what the ability of conduct of companies is to pass that along and  you know this they also suggested that there is some pricing power and in different sectors but broadly speaking theres a bit of a concern that  that companies may not be able to pass along the price sale have absorb it back into these motions exact you fixed it uses to where we are in the economic cycle of course the threat of recession a dont seem to be a big theme for twenty nineteen sent a question many peoples lives in the survey almost the analyst directly which stage of the economic cycle that companies are in and Michael this being question mark shift hasnt the house I mean much more support for the idea that expansion is extremely Mitchell many more and and lost youre calling out a slowdown in fact roughly one third of the analysts in the survey reported  a slow down this year of us is just over ten percent and and the prior year but still interesting the within the survey very little support the idea that were in recession what why not I mean because if you read headlines the so much negativity around some people seem to have taught in cells into it to a degree but the ominous and not saying that theyre not seeing it that this is not reflected in the fall Khan says not that thats not the number two the picking up from talking to companies no you might argues that companies are almost a loss to know in some cases but thats not to just not the message were getting I mean when I look at our numbers  the aggregate numbers from all of the financial models in the system  it is really consistent with the message that yes , growth is slowing  but were not in recession a clearly there are some factors that we need to think more closely product  in terms of fiscal stimulus  in terms of you know is the path of interest rates can be quite as aggressive as some of the sort of people calling for recession of talked but we certainly getting a more dovish tone of from the fed so far and and and twenty nineteen its definitely changed hasnt it mostly I have it I Im Michael raises the right point which is just growth is slowing but we also came more coming off of a very very strong creative growth in twenty eighteen so its still growth and  and I think thats whats driving a lot of the analysts responses is yes things are slowing down but its not disastrous and  at this point when they work twelve months out there still seeing high single digit earnings growth thaw in aggregate and so that that to me is is it still growth okay well let some intake another moments with one of five and honestly Sixers who covers financials for equities again hes been noticing other late cycle signals one of the phenomenon that weve seen in the back half of two thousand eighteen is  significant and box of alternative sources of capital which has been an inhibitor to US bank loan growth alternative sources of capital might be hedge funds private equity funds insurance companies or even loan funds by mutual fund companies it tends to enter the market sort of later in the cycle  you tend to find that that is  typically  yield seeking or S. C. seeking types of funds so bad news for banks that come to win to compete on on price perhaps most see tell me banks these alternative sources of capital as we mentioned this is classic wait cycle  signals where thanks to who are under Saddam significant regulatory scrutiny from the global financial crisis are still under this pressure and so you know companies need to raise funds and and theres demand and so theyre theyre looking at other sources of capital I think one of the this is that we really see in the credit markets is leverage clans and dom theres been phenomenal growth in leverage lands some of this is on the demand side people are sort of investors are positioning for a rise in rates and leveraged loans ten before reading rate instruments and so  do some natural hedging thats involved in that the risk is that leverage ones are supposed to be the safer part of the balance sheet and unfortunately because its late cycle companies have a lot of pricing power and theres very few investor protections that we typically like to see in a more senior part of the capital havent sold it to Julie the address there theyre not vigorous and in some cases nonexistent and so I think when we picks up on that it is something to really watch out for I mean its interesting from an equity point of view probably equity investors reassured that the banks and not chasing growth at the expense of margin because clearly  what we seeing since the global financial crisis of the banks significantly repairing the bond sheets substantially improving that capital ratios and really putting themselves in a position where for the first time since the crisis they can start really thinking about returning access capital to shareholders about boosting dividend growth and my sense is that bank investors would much rather see that capital come back to them  than chasing grace that may may not be there at attractive rates of return on on not comparable but they finally in a position  to tackle the Los crisis we could maybe talking another discuss it with them position for the for the next crisis whatever it might be a slightly better position of another crisis comes because that bound and shes here in much better state than they were last time around it we know with funding costs going up Marcy all the expectations that default rates would done it would go up this year well that thats a its picking up on quite a few themes heres what one of the dynamics in the markets  is we have a fairly flat yield curve in so what companies have been able to do it is if they if they would have taken advantage of of lower interest rates at the shorter term part of the capital structure they would have had more short term financing the fight your covers meant that they can push out these maturities so I think another one of the reasons that the analyst dont  dont see an imminent recession is that the funding what was quite a few years out and so if if you look at  at the statistics its not until twenty one twenty twenty one twenty twenty two we really look at refinancing needs for companies so no pressure really until then no big pressure and thats right , well that since  rather encouraging what some other positive things if you find in the survey Michael I think that some from an equity investors point of view  I think its important to note that we all ,  perhaps less positive from dividend growth outlook but still positive say to  dividend growth is in fact the strongest indicator of sentiment then the survey Im an I dig down into our analysts models and full combs yes weve got dividend growth slowing in twenty nineteen but we still looking for five percent globally thats a real rates of growth for us is inflation  and it is PO a little bit less than the eight percent we were seeing in twenty eighteen and I think similar picture emerges on things like capital spending yes Compaqs is weaker  but certainly that has to be seen in the context of a really a very strong survey for company spending in twenty eighteen of and in fact first predicted in the twenty seventeen so I went well lets talk about capixaba because it is interesting well get an analyst few cement while he is an embassy covers tech stocks and he points sites about how effects of fiscal stimulus in the states of fading meaning slow with business in his sector sentiment in IT spending has changed a fair bit from last year but I think that is   something which you should observe on reddit of Toms rather than absolutely with the reality around it says that last year United States which is one of the largest spenders and IT spending  had a significant tax change which allowed a lot of companies to move some of their tax savings into  into IT projects and that led to a significant acceleration in IT spending went up to eight nine percent if you will and  since that time for that as a comparison point  twenty eight nineteen was always expected to see a slowdown six months giving us an example there are some of the from looting this happening as a result of president trumps policies last year and it does that explain the folding capping six expectations we see in this year so well see it certainly plays into it and and clearly for if if you look at the U. S. there were two major themes going on last year you had some fiscal stimulus hitting the market and you had it at the change in tax code into both of those were significant drivers of earnings growth in twenty eighteen I think one of the things that came out of the survey is an expectation that the trump policies wont to be as a positive across the companies that that analyst cover this year well that shouldnt be that much of a surprise given that you know its twenty eighteen was such a big year and the political situation is a little bit less certain this year given that the Democrats have taken over the house so yeah Im Im not at all surprised to see that analysts are a little bit more cautious on the ability for the U. S. to manage some of the some of the the fiscal policies if youre an effect internationally Michael hello to the ominous tone quite negative  that they still just positive on trump within the U. S.  **** externally its its really concerned yes so I think theres been a real change in the narrative around trump I think when we look at the the prior surveys as a lot of discussion about the regulations in the financial sector and those talk about sort of pump priming through fiscal stimulus so clearly some the shyness come off that and at the same time the whole narrative around trade how being of at that rate will was very sick negative  take is I think it was particularly prevalent in the news at the time of of of the survey  said thats clearly one of the fact is we need to see how that plays out going and getting through twenty nineteen well lets hear talk retrieved from Asian a case of a claim is an analyst based in Hong Kong he covers the Asia regional tech hardware and semiconductors companies and hes telling us I did it more about that formed sentiment in China the biggest change observed in China over the last years of beating recent uncertainty by from consumers and corporates I think the major driver this is been the tried wards within the corporate sector I think there has been a big guy  push to delay automation of factories and could I see expansions in the back of their mind they have the risk that they may need to relocate their capacity to Southeast Asia to avoid  tariffs to Casey that telling us that companies are halted some investment in case they need to move hi T. also describes Taiwanese companies considering moving home from the mainland and American companies which have already moved operations to Southeast Asia Vietnam Malaysia and Thailand with that Stephanie had the outlook for China which is where weve seen the biggest full and interment isnt it it certainly had the outlook for China  sentiment with particular week in China  suit trade with it was it was part of the narrative but I also think just the economic performance particular fourth quarter was really some of the week because weve seen in China for a long time so  auto sales would down over the course of the year in in China  production the fourth quarter was down double digit every similar picture  emerging on smartphone sales so what were really seeing the first sort of negative numbers being printed and and in China sucking in the generation of the survey and I think one of the intriguing things was that yes sentiment in China was negative but actually the clue so you get China in terms of analysts on the ground the more negative it was a not sexual reversal of the of the of the prior survey where actually our analysts outside China a much more concerned and what about the picture in China because Im theres been some stimulus from oak monetary policy attempts to to to boost the economy the res fiscal stimulus as well but its but whats whats the picture there but growth is slowing  the government to has recognized theres too much debt in the system  its something we weve been paying attention to for quite some time and were starting to see some defaults in China and  you may be surprised to hear this from a fixed income person but this is actually a its a positive  thing that were starting to see a little bit of what I would call manage defaults  its not pervasive due to return to reality I think you can call it that its probably a good way to describe it Richard which is  you eat out its its very companies that perhaps received funding that didnt have the most robust business plan some of those companies are now being allowed to fail if you well and  yeah the idea is that were left with a healthier economy at the end and and if its managed well by by the government to early is is is quite involved in things then then I think it would leave us in a much healthier state and and that is our general view , lets just try and come up with a few summaries from from this years and in a survey Im whats the main message that your left with Michael at the end of all this Im very much left to the message of slow down rather than recession and a slow down we have to see in the context of a very high starting point in twenty eighteen mostly yeah I I I think that thats clear at it doesnt matter if your equity or fixed income that thats the view we ask the analyst a number of questions on ESPN sustainability and its clearly going last year the theme was is a dramatic increase in the focus on companies that we cover on the SD we didnt see that dramatic increase this year but we we we see a continual increase and things and and you know hang up on the China fame that showing some continued increase in the number of companies in China that are actually thinking about E. S. G. its a something thats a little bit surprising that came out of the survey its its that Tom in China even the number of come is that are focused on the S. G. continues to increase which isnt something youd expect in in in peoples preconceptions perhaps thats right of attitudes towards address routing sustainable thats right and  Id like to think that we have a little bit of something to do with that because you know analysts are asking lots of questions to management teams and we hope that thats planting a seed globally  for it for them to start thinking about sustainable issues and and Michael Im a give you an opportunity to think of anything surprising fit to that pops into the set AC first went through the data when we when we we got it back from the other lists I think too surprising things that I would highlight  one is perhaps hello we are saying its a slow down and and and there is a certain amount of looming doom that perhaps could be worse would be my question arm and the second thing is , in a perhaps people are just becoming you know for want of a better phrase bored with the whole political environment I definitely feel that some of the sort of geopolitical risks that clearly we can old list  having on the play what what what was sent in north as aggressively ,  recorded as a as I might have expected so not as bad as it could have been less  at a particularly thats a plus a one of a left hand sorry , well Michael say is multi drug can thank you both very much indeed for joining me and if you listing and would like to read the full analysts say maybe updated charts and detailed analysis on our website so thanks very much for listening to for investment professionals any the analysts survey edition I am Richard okay goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this put cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other part it without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices please see our website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen for that say "
17,18,"hello and welcome to a new series from fidelity international we we tap the brains of our analysts to learn about the industries and businesses your investing in Im Neal go Asia editor at fidelity Im at the Singapore zoo where every day thousands of visitors get up close and personal with a ring and things the worlds largest arboreal mammals these majestic ape spend most of our lives in the tree tops of the jungles of Sumatra and Borneo its where they eat sleep and raise their young but it might not be long before zoos are the only places left to see these creatures their critically endangered because millions sectors of their habitats have been illegally logged or cleared to make way for palm oil plantations and the palm oil producers are under increasing pressure from consumers NGOs and investors to lessen their end by  mental impact from the jungles of Southeast Asia we moved to the steel mills of northern China where the government is closing the least profitable and most polluting plants in part to reduce the toxic smog they can hang over the homes of hundreds of new ians of people this is strong arm top down industrial policy but it is still much financial losses and improved air quality , so what did these two stories of environment related pressure mean for the industry is in question was short term pain brought on by external pressures lead to long term gain for the companies and investors involved and what might that mean for other sectors facing similar challenges I spoke to fidelitys analyst on the ground need to find out , joining me here today infidelities Singapore offices in the heart of the marina bay financial district are for shields an equity investor an analyst who focuses on metals and mining across Asia and mainly a research associate who covers equities including palm oil producers among other things , four is the mainland welcome to you both thanks for it Chinas go has been taking a rather top down approach to cleaning up pollution added steel mills what have they been doing so that their original reason they had to eliminate this capacity was that you had a steel industry in a coal industry that had a trillion dollars of liabilities that were being effectively serviced so the government decided we need to do something to improve the profitability these companies so that they can pay down a lot of the step that they had and then when they decided to do this they were quite clever actually in saying that they would do this in a way they would have the Canary benefit of really improving atmospheric pollution so they went after the steel mills that were the dirtiest that were the most dangerous and they they just basically shut down this capacity seeing or talking several hundred million tons of capacity that was either illegal or just on needed really give us a sense of how big the steel industry is in China and that the amount of capacity the taken out what is that in the the bigger picture they eliminated probably a hundred and twenty million tons of the legal still capacity there were and being record and statistics anywhere and probably some around two hundred million tons of legal capacity seat youre talking about to North America is worth of steel consumption of capacity that were wiped off the face of the earth has theyve done is weve seen market improvements in the air while the in China particularly in the northeast where the topography is particularly challenging and pollution tends to get trapped in the winter basically a move pretty epic proportions in terms of the scale and scope of things yeah I mean it just is the same as you saw like the growth of the steel and stream channel is probably something weve never seen you know in the history of the world weve never seen a D. capacity Porsches big is this anywhere else in the world either Milan a palm oil producers of also come under pressure from external party so we say to reduce their impact on environment that pressure those come from something quite different than what weve seen in China whats the situation there so a lot of the pages have been coming from consumers from the role so for example Unilever Nestle they have been coming in the present and hes only because of the way they have been sourcing Pomeroy as well as concerns on the Wii palm oil has been produced and planted how I plantations actually result in deforestation because forest have to be clear in order for planting to take ladies and actually is one of the key producing crop for Indonesia apart from Cuba and pulp for example and then also usually leads to a loss of biodiversity because is known that when Pomeroy plantations replace forest this results in the loss of flora and fauna India lingering at things including our own with tons SL as Asian elephants this much on Pegasus well I kind of lost as a result of palm only plan patients replacing Flores and then the pressure come in basically from buyers and yeah many from bias at the end of the supply chain forest the steel in the palm oil industries than their impact on the environment and pretty different ways but one way they both have a very visible impact on the environment is in terms of air quality specifically youve been in northern China on a bad hair day or whats on that later on apocalypse  can you paint the picture for us a little bit yeah I tend to go to the the less touristy parts of China as you know a metal mining analyst Im usually going to steel mill town owns an aluminum smelters in coal mining towns in you know I can think when I was in John Joe maybe half a year ago a year ago it was in one of their worst air quality days and this is one of the worst cities in China for air quality that is soon as we got off the train and left this Asian you know everyones eyes were burning in the back of your throat you have this kind of like gritty feel and it smells a bit of sulfur or rotten eggs it its pretty pretty intense will when you keep in mind this is a city of like nine ten million people were not talking about me wandering through the actual aluminum smelter this is just walking through the city by the train station on the flip side you know you go to the cities and it looks a lot like Shanghai used to look to me in no two thousand four two thousand five or whatever and there has been this on the flipside include rebel improvement in the quality of peoples lives actually on that same sharp way went to John Joe I was in a hotel and I think tank son in there is a guy who had kind of a bit odd Chinese and I thought the first maybe use making fun of my Chinese since my pronunciation isnt perfect either but I realize that I have actually almost death he was wearing this very high tech you know hearing aid I was thinking man when I came to China seventeen years ago a guy like this wouldnt have been engaged in the economy at all he wouldnt be able to be a productive person because no one would be able to afford this when youre traveling through these place you see the flip side of this industrialization you know this development has really been incredibly beneficial for these guys but on the flip side the environment it you know it it has to be addressed , with the the ear pollution I know maybe thats not the main issue when it comes the palm oil production but it has been this specifically here in Singapore right yeah I think the whole issue on at pollution and actually picked into specific yes in Singapore with a think about it in twenty thirteen and two the fifteen so first why is kind of broke out in Indonesia and then result that an apple you send their letters burning down version Forrester or it can be yes slash and burn well as a result of dry weather can a she just even result in primary forests being button as well so its kind of hard to track but if we look at satellite mapping the only thing that we can kind of attribute it to is the fact that thats been burning happening here as a result slash and burn and then be attribute the blame to them so its slash and burn so that you can plant home trees basically yeah so if I were to measure how bad taste condition was in Singapore I think on the clear the we have PSIs of about thirty forty NPS eyes were actually more than three hundred doing those two yes date that the in twenty fifteen I thing around the months of October also and thats when it comes to that really has it as levels schools I usually close when yes I switched between two hundred to three hundred and in Indonesia there will be parts that PS eyes will be on one thousand the issue is kind of escalate that when sing up all government race this to Indonesia it became a political kind of issue and so then thank in the pressure on Indonesias governments to make sure that the they do something about the air pollution I recall walking on the street and moss well actually all sold out everywhere and I have to use my head as a filter with regard to air pollution and thats one kind of symptom of expanding palm oil production but the bigger one as you said earlier is kind of the loss of biodiversity and deforestation what are the companies themselves doing about this or how are they responding to this in these pressure viewed from consumers or intermediary buyers or even from you know neighborly governments like a like Singapore I think I want to go back in history in terms of the regulations coming out in making sure how my plantation I kind of sustainability run will actually go back to a point in time in twenty oh fall when the round table for sustainable palm oil was phone from a several stake holders a we have W. W. F. you need liver and then the militia Pomeroy S.  C. shin and several other stakeholders coming together to come out we spend that switched eighteen will be suitable and applicables to the palm why industry in terms of the environmental  social and help local communities should be better manage to a press the key challenges relating to the palm oil industry and as a result companies that that applying these standards in that planting and it was only in twenty eleven when the Indonesia government started coming up with the more time IBM to prevent new confession to palm why plantations from primary forest areas and as a result of the precious coming out from the haze issues and bring that in in twenty fifteen the Jokowi government which came in in twenty five Stan came up with a new regulation to extend the moratorium so this has actually resulted in companies stopping new plantings especially from your twenty ten on what so we now see a much reduced or even zero piece of new plantings at least from the company site which can be more visibility regulate and then what is the effect of that in terms of overall supply growth across the street I think if we were to go back into hi Im the planting for palm oy actually came in between twenty all Fife and twenty one ninety four Indonesia we have about at least twenty thirty percent growth in new plantings every year and since the moratorium came out in twenty eleven we are now seeing negative zero new plantings data coming out from companies what we are seeing right now is small replant things because Palmer has a twenty five year cycle so for those they have reached maturity they will then have to be planned so new plantings of very limit that from twenty ten on whats and as a result of this even think about the impact on public supply well start seeing the whole supply of palm only going down more dramatically from twenty nine then on what the structural under supplied basically that weve kind of the yeah if I were to compare against the mon off lets see forty five percent pay ya for global demand for all of about sixty million tons of my consumption Padilla , moving elegantly to China and this steel production similar situation you using a lot of supply coming off line how does that affect the near to mid term outlook for profitability of the sect yeah actually should draw a distinction that its not supply going off line its capacity going off line so if you look at steel production in two thousand eighteen it was actually very strongly up year on year but because theyre competing against less capacity as for your people able to produce the profitability has improved sharply if you think of like a normal through cycles steel spread and by spreading mean the price of steel minus the three main material and puts you know iron or cook Colin scrap the normal spread would be somewhere you know between two hundred dollars two hundred and twenty two hundred thirty dollars somewhere in there and during two thousand seventeen the two thousand seventeen two thousand eighteen the spread was closer to three hundred dollars you know the high two hundred dollars so you know thats not just a fifty percent improvement in profitability because you have a lot of fixed cost depending on the company could have seen a much bigger increase profitability and that was also seen a big improvement in however these companies are as there been able to pay down a lot their debt are there softer costs to complying with this saving from a from a company standpoint  theyd challenged with you know spending more investing more to meet the crater environmental emissions conditions or regulations yeah I think this is about as close as you get to everyone kind of just winning right the external costs are yes deal is going to be slightly more expensive a ton but thats really passed on to the eventual consumers of steel so you know if you look at can any saber building maybe no single digit percentage of it is still cost and and that went up by a few percentage were talking a few percentage on a few percentage so you dont really see that cost impact anywhere on a social level but the benefit is huge in that you really reduce the financial sector risk like before the steel mills are going bankrupt could really bankrupt the Chinese banking system and before you know when we had all the sturdy capacity was it was clearly negatively impacting peoples health so I think this has been really you know as an economic decision with incredibly positive environmental externalities and theres I guess another component to a you talk about the systemic risk of underperforming companies theres also a potentially an unemployment problem that could be created there yeah I mean thats another the interesting point  but if you think about the Chinese labor force this is no longer growing this is been shrinking every year for the last couple years so the need to really create jobs in China is much lower than it would have been even five years ago just based on that demographic shape of you know whatever you wanna call that the age  profile of China we no longer really need to create as many jobs you know yes there is a need to create higher quality jobs yes you see urbanization where you want to give jobs to people in the countryside but the level of pressure that the government is under is much lower than it was before the other kind of issue I I was thinking of is you know China was ruffling feathers among keep trading partners with vast amounts of steel exports the let down the years and now if youre reducing capacity taking a city of liner days then this incentivized to export into your trade relationships get a little bit better yeah your intuitions correct youve seen a drop in exports in fact of steel from China as you both because theyve had and a reduction in the amount of capacity have but also because there is strong demand for the steel so in two thousand eighteen there was a drop in exports and beyond that it kind of doesnt really matter if youre exporting it youre importing steel because this spread that everyones enjoying it is kind of comment everyone across the planet so Chinas consuming about half the steel on the planet Chinas producing about have to stay on the planet if Chinese profitability improves American profitability improves to some degree Japanese profitability improves to some degree so this improvement and utilization that China has enjoyed has also been enjoyed by everyone else around the world as well , mean it with polio producers in the profitability situation is it a comparable situation where this coming kind of shortage of capacity will increase the profitability it would impact on palm oil prices thats yet to be proven my pieces is that it will start coming in twenty nineteen doing twenty when we start seeing the supply shocked each coming through as a result of new plan things going down to zero or even negative levels from twenty ten on whats but right now what we are seeing is a situation of oversupply in the end people always market and one of the key drivers for palm why prices is actually debt off so Ive been on a flight because thats a key substitute for Pomeroy so thats one of the key elements that will kind of affect the dynamics of help Pomeroy prices should treat apart from the whole supply shop each issue as well force would be seeing in China if you look at the winter of two thousand seventeen to the start of two thousand eighteen beyond that the capacity reduction programs they also have  production restriction programs capacity reduction programs are really just about getting rid of excess I see to improve the profitability the winter restrictions are really focus just on environmentally troubled areas in and saying produce less steel during this time wore emit less pollution during this time is theyve kind of shifted to but in the winter of twenty seventeen slash eighteen we saw twenty five percent year on year improvement of key air quality KPIs as measured by the Chinese ministry of environment ecology their target was fifteen percent so the the over shot this part of this was due to you know whether an atmospheric conditions being particular favorable yeah but either way that the government really made it a market improvement  youre on your and what they were looking to do so you know the environmental groups we talk to they were incredibly happy like they were impressed with the progress I think its exceeded everyones expectations where does that leave us whats next in China are we going to continue to see these twenty five percent reductions youre on youre in Lupins animations or is that a temporary blip I think that the twenty five percent reduction we probably wont be able to match that rate of decline but I think the decline in pollution and will continue theres been a change of strategy where is before the central government gave down top down orders to you know , eliminate X. amount of capacity in this region or you know restrict production X. amount in that region now theyre saying look were more concerned with the outcome were less concerned with how you achieve that so if you want to invest in scrubbers or if you want invest in some other technology to reduce your emissions you know more power to you and were going to allow the local governments figure out how to reach their targets rather than telling them reach your emissions targets via  capacity for actions are production reductions and then I think once we get a little bit further along I think the next battles really are gonna be for water and then the final battle is is for ground or soil preclusion and water is not as much of an issue for metal mining it is an issue but for aluminum red mud creation which is  by product of making a Lumina is a huge issue and so I expect this will be a big topic that well be talking about in future years minorities and things go from here if your forecast swelled up well see a falloff in capacity shortfall basically wouldnt that then encourage another flurry of people running out in the in converting forest land into palm oil production again so the more times on a tooth for I feel basis but have been consistently renewed because of external pressures coming through from environmental watch groups at the governments to make sure that  the pollution stand that are contained in Indonesia and Malaysia so in terms of the flurry of new plantings coming through I think that that one happened this cycle I guess the next battle for the puck more industry its mall of ensuring that smallholders comply what we are seeing in the past few years has been the pressure on the that companies are larger companies to make sure that they comply with the sustainability standards but it has been hot to ensure that small hold this leave up to the same level as than that and I think we need to address that because the fumble forty percent of total production in order for people to really change the impression that we have on Pomeroy as a whole yeah clearly some big challenges there Im afraid were out of time for today but its been a fascinating look at how to giant industries have been engaging with cigna an external pressures over their environmental impact and what their responses mean for both their

S. trade will mean for markets and we take the temperature of the sickly health care sexism defensive or defective store listen on to find out more , with me in the studio to help decipher the thinking behind this months asset allocation  and is to be its gonna head of global macro economics and investment strategy to come report for any manager with a focus on global high yield credits and James Bateman chief investment officer for multi asset welcome to you all as always I go to Rivoli tree question to get to started your revelations I hasten to add Im its three hundred years since the publication Robinson Crusoe Id like to know what one icing would you take with you if you were marooned on a desert island Anna lets start with you I decided to go for us some lotion with the very high protection assuming I will end up  someone very sign the island lets hope it is sunny does it might end up city what about you well Im gonna go more tech can all say a solar powered water filtration system  I dont know how long Ill be there in that I know I need water to stay alive maybe to start making some in perhaps as well , Im James certified two ounces neither of which are pretty practical the flip on was a very large container of total source because clearly anything treatment as ondas fish and then the less flippant but to stave off boredom was hello because if I was stuck on a desert island for many many years I might by the end of F. mustard playing well and if not it makes good firewood it was , I would like to hear you next time has playing as you are at the moment that would certainly reduce the this Michelle thanks to look forward to I know what were really here to talk about is the highest you can you tell us whats the allocation is now as agreed by the the team around the table where men you tell inequities son both in the short term in the medium term  and this is really a reflection of of the same thing that you have been talking about for a few months now and and that is with  believe there is said disconnect between  economic fundamentals said  and the market so the V. shaped recovery that to have seen in equity markets has since the start of the year  mess it has gone ahead the fundamentals so we still thing that to being more cautious on equities and risk make sense of it concerns that what about the other asset classes  when now under way to a gunman Boland said again both come a time horizon said in the short term and medium term and still await credit in the near term so this is three to six months but mutual over a  twelve to eighteen months okay so over to shift away from from wrist some shift away here but obviously ending  the duration on divert underweight meaning that when not concerned about your session and that is something that is perhaps reflected to some extent and in the the common bond market okay well pizza with your interest Im in with us tell us what what your view is on on duration that and how his is developed since the fed change this time its really a question of risk reward  in the course of the first quarter of this year we seen government bond markets around the world  overshoot  expectations of changes in policy over the course of the next six to twelve months  and real rates in particular now have become much more fairly valued in the U. S. whereas sick months or so ago you could invest in the treasury markets in pick up a real yield of nearly a hundred basis points thats now been slashed in in more than half and looking at our own forecasts of intermediate term inflation  evolution in the US we think that  the amount of compensation that youre getting in government bonds at the at the moment it is simply not enough for the risks that youre taking  not to mention increasing ever increasing supply it seems  in the U. S. and how are you reacting with the right  pull figures well  as Anna noted were still looking at a situation whereby were not expecting at the onset of a recession in the immediate near term so we would expect in that environment  excess return from spread product and thats how were positioned and really that underweight in government bonds that represents  an opportunity to capture that excess return for us within fixed income portfolios okay James Raymond Im how does that so much your thinking in the multi asset team not dissimilar I mean I think what it was interesting to us is we spent the first half of the rest of the , causing about what would derail equity market momentum at a mixture of fed behavior in and more recently tariffs seems to be effectively doing about as honest as that back to the two words fundamentals but at the same time it doesnt doesnt make a lot of sense to us to to be hedging are sort of positions in terms of recession risk because the light could recessions actually receded rather than increased so who are you waiting something big to happen before you change your your views you know sort of holding person if you dont see yes but I suppose with the caveat the the clearly this is a an environment right for short term positioning so so we are clearly playing short term market back if he is Im not quite sure where in a so so the river by the fact scenario but but was certainly approaching that way the risk of certified to trade was it set for throws up very short term volatility that you can take advantage of because the market will be the under react beforehand or for after an event  and check just on just before we came in we hurts that China had to decide it was going to a levy some tariffs on about sixty billion dollars worth of US goods this is all power for the coast now is that we are we are we are ready for that sort of news it would be a if you were to try to didnt retaliate the interesting thing of course is theyve delayed implementation until the beginning of June so its not affected immediately I presume thats partly trying to give the the U. S. a bit of leeway to come to a compromise I doubt that will happen in time but in this sort of game game of  economic bring when schip one there are no winners it from the comic perspective its taken her  in terms of price hikes coming through I think the key question to us is that she watching US behavior in terms of do we see the cost increases which not quite substantial passing through to and consumers and if we do do we see a sort of political fallout that means trump caught this you this policy for that no less what the Chinese will be watching as well the central question of contract is trump have to fold at some point we keep this is a bluff going so its the hes waiting for the diplomatic game to start playing as in the economic data sent as it happens if it does he of course we got several propriety tools to help us I am so sorry that sort of thing one of them is the fidelity leading indicator the fly aggregates a range of a success to form a picture of the state of the global economy and where its heading well any articles that without markets research analyst in some sin for reading if this months fly after returned a much more optimistic what do I mean much less pessimistic reading than it has for awhile what in welcome to you Im his talk about the fidelity leading in the case of the flight now thats moved into a positive reading for the first time since February two thousand seventeen is it time to crack open the champagne well you say policy Richard it is positive exploration for the first time since since way back then but its still points to growth at below trends  info call the the top left quadrant so yes acceleration is still relatively soon shoots and certainly below trend growth levels so the question really is the heart is the fly progress from here so were going to probably get a Boston and growth sometime in Q. three given that the the fly tents have but three month lag but thats not really enough to get excited about so looking at the the underlying indicator thats what I wanted to ask where is the the sudden positivity coming from because weve been in the doldrums down in the growth negative Im listening I mean he wants to wake up to that   every morning so hes not finally turned a corner where is that improvement coming from so looking at the the individual sectors the improvements reasonably broad based so business surveys grinding that bit higher industrial orders shes starting to to  reflect that to the consumer in labor indicators of  per top and most notably global trade which it had a horrible and  to to last year and has has reached quite decisive both but I think whats perhaps most interesting is looking at some of the individual indications that are really turned these are the ones that really looks quite catastrophic going into the source of this year  and theyve Barnes  from for really nexus levels and into the Senate this might just be a the normalization after you know I almost flew Klay and weak patch that to me suggests that there might not be that much more improvement in the next couple this is a dead cat balance is not that Im missing a blip in its going to catch a is going to fall back to where it was I would say its a bit more than a dead cat bounce things arent as bad as you might have thought at the start of the year and but at the same time it might not be  the main cast Barnes one Mister stumbles on castle three legs yes okay so you talked about the three month lag what should we expect then for the rest of this year based on what youre seeing in the in the fly the three month lag suggests give that were only just getting into politics celebration now is that we see  something of a boss many activity early in the third quarter of this year  and then thinking a bit beyond that as I say it might be a couple of months of stumbling around as we try and make that that decisive floor beyond that I think towards the end of the year some of the the policy measures we have seen coming in the fads the US federal reserve turning more dovish and some Russian market banks are and that yes China certainly Im doing a very large fiscal stimulus in credit similis in Q. one that will take time to feed through and it seems like at the the end of the year sana mile coalesce and and their coverage starts to gain a bit more traction so some pain on ice for S. related cast thats exactly it thank you very much here ,  and a a very   summary perhaps the phone of the fly that on the surface it does seem to be a significant moment would you agree with them with the INS reading all this Susan and the first time in many months to to get this reading  so it is significant that but I think its a mess to be seen what it goes from here it can some back could aid to the deteriorating quadrant we do know that too Q. one day to was distorted in the US and China and and divisions globally by a number of factors  and the inventory accumulation cycle was one of them and so some of the distortion is now washing out in the sense that can buys the dates to the up sides and to the down side I think there are tentative signs of civilization  but its too early to call to call that the green shoots definite creamed shoes soon to say whether we should avoid a recession in the yeah exactly and I think it as I do it we will see some civilization the whole voting on this levels  we will likely see that over the next two months then second half of the of this hes going to be a bit clearer in terms of direction and my base case is that then we will avoid  for the slow down and and recession but the expansion the head is likely to be relatively said toot okay and Im pizza do you take soccer from from this from  the fly improving well the two would gree but as Anna mentions again that the jury is out as to whether or not were just in transition from a growth phase into a proper credit default cycle or whether thats been forestalled and we were really will see a then a last and perhaps final phase of the expansion that were in at the moment we we certainly do take a little bit of additional  constructive signal from the fly in that it probably means that the default cycle together the amount of ample liquidity provision thats been provided by the center banks  is not going to going to descend upon us  in the next quarter or so but visibility beyond that into the end of the second half of the  of this year and into the beginning twenty twenty remains very limited as positive as I would expect to fixed income checked it to to be maybe but the glass is always half empty in these uses and to and James was right to it was that you I dont think I have the  desprit differing opinion I think either the controls positives in the reading on the fly before the way that we see a mature an upswing and then it it we see a further deterioration and that is an entirely plausible perhaps even likely outcome so as we said about market says with economies which whats the end of the cycle the only question is how close we are to the end of course with any of the note Im off to the event I guess you have the three to six months view is somewhere between comfortable in and in a may be positive but beyond that and be a storm clouds loom okay what we come back to you piece of them because of the high yield market is often called the Canary in the coal mine your at the coal face are you seeing any wiring signals the only just a few at the moment but none of them seem to have really developed into a proper contain Jim mechanism to infect the rest of the the capital markets so you know certainly weve seen the risk adjusted under performance of triple C. credits which are the most highly levered balance sheets that  that we can own in in high yield  investors are unwilling to dip down into that low quality sector because it tends to be very highly levered to to growth and or  the opportunity to  to refinance of either one of those too  killers of  performance is eroded from here we would expect triple sees to to get hit first and investors reluctance to basically buy everything in a dash for trash kind of style  in it is so foreign in twenty nineteen is a little bit of a warning sign the other one  emerge mark its clearly we have some on going rolling crisis in both Argentina and Turkey but it seems to have been contained within those two jurisdictions for now could spill over its at some point but really requires additional external catalysts to do so so it sounds more like a watching brief fanatics but well another area of the market which I am sending these when fear is great because it seemed by investors as a defensive sector is healthcare but hes been in the headlines of late not for being a haven a safe haven but because if its terrible performance is a date the sector is down eleven percent compared to you  global indices well earlier today I close up with some of the diocese healthcare team over coffee to find out whats been bringing the site to dam and has some rigorous research is help them Dodge the full Alex in your the portfolio manager with a focus on the  on healthcare and  its been a pretty  difficult year to date  what was going on yes  in a house being quite he said the healthcare sector is down about eleven seventy eight states to the end of April and this really said rice in the last month I think the main drive is behind not being some of the fiscal noise it restricts coming out to the US in particular as we sh you know I guess a year and a half way the twenty twenty elections in November a veces getting increasingly concerned about if teens teach for reform day from health cap space to generate itll say drug prices and insurance is off so a lot of political pressure coming too bad I mean it really is  asset to thats right for this was a change in the state , yes I think this to six now is about seventeen to eighteen sensitive GDP in the US spends on health S. so its always a very tough cold in a happy how does that compare to other countries so other countries its  was playtime sent in the majority of countries in the rest of western Europe for example so these companies are looking rather scared now I what the point is interesting is that the farmer on the minus cat which is the US health insurers in particular has increased risk of  are the government intervention all the pricing would distance mediation on the insurance side of things  so those companies more space for some of the others in a medical technology ally sassa tools companies that have less  expiration okay what got some pre since Im here  who the analysts who were looking  at this sector and spotted these concerns briefs  let me Im to you first of all how did you come to make that call yeah so I mean Ive covered the managed care sector among other stocks for three years and not involve living through the the twenty sixteen election where  these managed care smokes for more big winners from the Republican when and the the stocks perform very strongly out of that the whole period since then the the issues being we know that it could be rescue into the next election its an issue more of timing so when when do you start to question these companies that have very strong fundamentals in a state Cole verses the fact that the status quo could go away and actually theres no theres no business for them this has catastrophic kids act in terms of that business model I mean they do other things but basically yeah they they manage the insurance coverage of Faye  of the population through the commercial insurance somewhere SO sourced on the the government site if the government does it all like a like the NHS then theres no role for for these businesses and then the debate for Alex and others investing and says how far in that spectrum do you goal because there is another  scenario for actually they can do more to help but yeah its its its of life and death of some whats your view on this on this particular aspect so without the benefit of  covering the stocks in the last election it was important for me to understand how they tried in previous elections side Manaus is really focused on how I managed care tried in the last five elections and  revealed to me firstly the risk is certainly there around healthcare policy reform its whats driven draw downs in the past and Hillary tweet is a great example of where sentiment can arise and a second later that Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton Senate and and tweets what happens inside twenty fifteen September that Hillary Clinton came out with an incendiary tweets essentially on  on on high drug pricing and even though I managed care was directly related of course the most affected trading down twenty percent for the end of the year so we see that kind of sentiment  affecting managed care in the past we also dont really see the rewards that you would expect a rebound going into the election because the sentiment cant buy the hang campus sister right through the election but if you do look at history you can also say that healthcare form reform of the U. S. tends to be of a story of incrementalism rather than a complete transformation so for that reason I came out slightly less extreme the Bruce did on ultimately medic for materializing but still very cautionary on  political rhetoric affecting the sentiments in multiples of the medical sector obsidian in century or inspiring depending on whether your from a company on also correct okay an attic so how did this Im higher than in a new four failures you hearing this advice from the finance yes it Amandas cat sectors about ten percent of the into the global health care and that social invest in so is highly material and although I only had a small life wait and in that sub sector three his early thoughts than caution was very important because it focused my mind  on the issue as early as February notch Ralph than in a waiting perhaps until later on this year and that led me to just my position in Sam was that Shea I you know have not a note exposure on the name and Im Im equal weight that subject in the managed care yes ani Kuwait subsect seven HRH inspiration so with that money go instead where the  say for me in a health care is very does the US access and is about much more than just farm there and health insurers in biotech we have lots of  good medical technology companies which makes of the equipment Cena hips and knees hearing aids for example and those two companies which is what forty since the fund is invested in and have in my opinion strong fundamentals mustache pricing risk because there any six percent of total government spend combat says Palmer is a twelve percent and in a managed care as much grace portion from that great okay well Alex three Sam thank you very much indeed , when Anna and we could hear that was a big influence politics can be on the performance of the sectors of becoming more of a theme for markets generally I would say it has been already for a few years but my changes since before the age of twenty sixteen elections at and of course the since the whole brexit said in a referendum that it has been a big you said why mince , well you did us both policies as has been Elizabeth cries of particular with addresses in time Im being  the push to now too and it was the end of this year  but of course is hasnt gone the way so we have the race coming up of the European elections in the couple weeks yeah and then we be watching it well what happens afterwards Lou with European Commission leadership etcetera  and then have the US elections coming up and those certain its Tom but is there a day campaigning with with the with the trade to war  the tensions escalating Im and that it was us and thats something thatll meta for the markets of course theres a lot of noise in politics so as always its its very important to distinguish a signal and what actually matters for fundamentalist just from noise that moves markets and affects headlines that piece of from a fixed income bunker what is keeping you awake at night on on the political front well aside from the regional and  seasonal issues that  that on as mentioned here it really its down to that a relationship between the  the two global superpowers in whether or not we are just in  absurd late rounds  laid hands of a of a poker match or whether there is something a little bit more structural going on there and turn the schism between China and the U. S.  and the outcomes for the leaders of both of those  systems at the moment may actually be better in terms of their own ability to play to their base and reinforce their own power by continuing to escalate as a those two reaching  an agreement quite  quite quickly and in a clearly marked disappointment around thats over the course of the last week  is manifesting itself  yet market still want to believe that over the course of the next four to eight weeks itll all be okay and well have a resolution and were not  in the midst of a massive geo political inflection  and I think that thats just a little bit sad to underpriced at the moment and just to confirm that your glass is now empty not even how often to when are coming to the end of this post costs which means its time to play hot cakes and hot potatoes what would your body like hot cakes what would you drop like a hot potato let me start with you again Im in in the currency world I like this is Frank  good safe haven perhaps against the basket of both the dole and the euro , they did the euro weakness potentially  but this is a decent currency like the Japanese yen which I preferred last time and by the way it has done quite well , weve actually should follow ups and we at the end of the what about your hot potato , and develop market duration we we we have discussed it and I think the yield said I really so alone now and then  supported by fundamentals okay James hopes cake Im hot Kate Richard is anything thats that so tentative and Ive said that before but nothing that doesnt have a traditional market exposure to his cash plus and and you know that could be could be Im it was the most exotic youd go for timber September I mean the most exotic but how would I mean I typically  you know wouldnt famo also releasing some  I think thats a a nice area to be at the moment or just you know it conventional short strategy the something without direction because I dont think nows the time to have a directional position on in any real asset class I would you drop I think a drop and I was I was pondering this one a lot  US equities in particularly gross of love and what if you want to call it but but but you know tactically but but you in general and I think that is that the market is up much speech related to property pricing in a six to eight week resolution to the trade war with China and either six to eight months is perhaps more likely maybe longer but that for I think the idea the the the the US went at least get derailed partly from that is is is perhaps naive actually there is a story in which it causes in an S. of global re writing a rotation away from U. S. that could be quite significant so thats my up data okay and  pizza final thought with you your hot cakes what would you buy yeah hot cake would be generically anything that represents the kind of risk that we can buy in fixed income markets it looks an awful lot like what James is just advertises is hot cakes so looking for stuff with strong asset cover strong security package weve seen quite a lot of very interesting new issuance in the high yield markets  your dates  that has transitioned out of the loan market and has thus been looking to  X. press itself in a different way from companies that are distressed within the high yield markets but in exchange for that they need to offer up some additional security some better asset cover something that we can sleep more comfortably at night with holding through the next downturn and cycle because we expect that said recoveries will be impaired  in those security so for the moment thats my sort of generic  hot cake and your potato hot potato hot potato I think I agree again with what James said on the tax side thats not necessarily reflected in in valuation valuations pretty balanced in in technology credits but in telecom credits  particularly in US investment grade telecom  that sector is trading pretty much at the time its its difficult to see how much additional spread compression you might get their put another way the margin for safety  in in those asset valuations is very limited at the moment  so I think that  they could be considered a source of funds to buy something a little bit more secure actually good well thats its  I hope thats giving you an insight into the thinking behind this months asset allocation if youd like more detail is published in full on our websites and if youd like to discuss anything weve covered just Oscar fidelity context so thank you very much indeed to Mike yes at first here in the studio Anna pizza and James as well as Ian adding spruce and Sam in our factory and thank you very much indeed for listening goodbye this put cost is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or sex eighty to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices please see our website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash out hyphen fidelity "
19,20,"this podcast is for investment professionals I mean a , this is an investors guide to a new pot costs from fidelity international , Im Paris and then head of asset management Asia Pacific and Ill be taking you deep into Chinas economy what makes the country take there is the most exciting and the ones to avoid , fidelity is built up decades of experience in China and each episode when you fidelitys portfolio manages research on this and other specialists who cover the market I could share with you their expertise last year has been historic for Chinese capital markets company share and bombs have stepped into the international spotlight included on global indices for the first time but how open is trying to renew to investors exactly how far down the road liberalizations China stand today Im what should investors watch full next , to help me on these questions Im joined by three of fidelitys China experts with me in Shanghai Linda Jo a portfolio manager hes based in the city Linda your based here about how long have you known trying high , Im Im actually Shanghainese I was born and brought up here I went to Hong Kong for study and and for the  will in the last year its basically the open up of the China market bring me back so I relocate a whole family back to Shanghai after almost twenty years and joining us from Hong Kong we have Brian Collins a portfolio manager and head of Asian fixed income so Brian how much just trying to figure in your Asia portfolios , one is a significant part about portfolios directly and indirectly but you could easily account for half of the exposures that we have and and growing frankly and of course indict Klay China has a significant influence on on Asia less the rest of the world and also in Hong Kong we have George Estes topless a portfolio manager in the multi asset team so George how close are you to the Chinese market in recent years we have on a selves increasingly participating in China across the cops the cops structure whether it is China bones sort of see GBs so the second part of the Cup structure increasingly the past year or so in China high yield and more recently in Chinese it is well so particular put in for us in recent years thanks George and thank you all for joining me today Linda the does hes been in China for a decade and a Hoffman you know you can see that the Shanghai skyline his change beyond all recognition in that time but what the countrys financial markets where are we in that journey yeah thats actually a very interesting questions for now because we all know that China by far is still a relatively more close up market  you know we have the capital account is to pretty much closed  the financial markets is just dumb in the past two to three years the the open up happening what is really encouraging news in a pasta when you we do see that speed of open up  actually accelerate to cry a lot probably thats because  its one of the negotiation conditions on hope the trade war but we still very happy to see that process and brought to Georgie but a both very frequent visitors to China but from your vantage point in Hong Kong whats your take on the pace of change Brian I would say its a little mixed I mean its very rapid I mean Im I very much look at the domestic capital markets in China  and see them as not developed but rapidly develop so in some respects the rate of growth in the size of the market for one has been impressive I meant so I mean weve never seen this before in terms of the growth of a debt capital market or capital markets more generally the good thing for China  is that Scott large established develop markets around the rest of the world which it can effectively  Mira or at least reflective will take the best all of if you will weve seen some good improvements with the regulatory oversight especially around the banking system in around  regulating shadow banking for example in cheddar financing channels over the last couple of years in particular , yet on the other hand there are some aspects little things which still have a long wait go one of the obvious ones that we feel is significant for the onshore domestic bond markets is simply allowing greater use of really basic derivatives like bond futures government bond futures for example which are available and they used but for example is international participants when not yet able to use that as a some other participants now we feel that that will change and will obviously continue to develop in this always this balance between making show that the development of any capital market is  measured its controlled its not excessive all creating any kind of systemic risks but on the other hand given the size the fact that the bond markets thirty no trillion US L. as in size we we expect within the next five to six years that number to be easily thirty trillion U. S. dollars in size thats as big as the U. S. debt capital markets so if you think about in size terms theyre gonna quite each other very soon but when you think about the day in Britain the sophistication of the two markets China is well well well behind so its got lots of room an opportunity to continue to grow Im was seen that same sort of a development all seven the symptoms of the HMO I could as well when we think about sort of indexes  inclusion at George one night when I look at the the Chinese market despite the sort of the developments all that the death of it liquidity of the market the volatility of the market still gives me the impression that its still a very immature  developing markets whats your perspective on life it is a more retail driven market so the retail investors on soaring China theyre responsible for roughly about eighty percent of trading selectivity of two and over when they hold about twenty percent of the outstanding these numbers are slowly changing with the inclusion of we so we are seeing a little bit of those than Im exchange its still very early days I think about ten percent how often of of of the outstanding service is is held by by forty investors so this will gradually change dynamics and will have a positive impact on volatility but having said that Id also like sort of to mention in inclusion typically what happens when a country gets included in in an index you tend to have the buy a buy the rumor sell the fact thats what happened with you you a Qatar and even going back within a Taiwan and Korea sort of for many many years ago and this come around with China its been the exact opposite we we we we we knew that was gonna be inclusion sometimes of earlier this year with in particular no the the extent of it but last year despite decent earnings growth in China we saw a huge  ge huge compression of multiples so we didnt really see sort of this buying buying the rumor setting the fact that then created a very interesting buying opportunity on the back of very attractive valuations after the revolution compression of last year on the market is definitely becoming more interesting and Austria it was because you know we gotta multiple surprises  from both inside and outside I think outside one  to treat what one is probably still going on but inside a wise idea Phoenicia market to leverage is almost to come to the end so it does look more interesting from now unless they would trade rules for a bit obviously with it were in this environment now terrace being imposed by the U. S. on China in the retaliation at the Wiz seeing George how serious is this and how much of an impact is it having on your asset allocation views as if youll sort of thinking through the portfolios is a short term situational something that you see kind of extending for full courses ahead of us  trade was  the key thing that we monitoring  on on trade was is what is the impact on the Chinese economy and from my perspective moved on a lot of work trying to understand from the bottom up what this should really mean and the impact it has and today versus ten fifteen years ago the impact two days very very different because today the Chinese economy has managed to transition from an expert driven economy to one that that played a big part of GDP growth is driven by the consumption story so trade war fifteen years ago would have had a much bigger impact than what it has  to day Id like to come in on currency though because I think you know one of the things I found off Im finding particularly surprising was how weak the currency was as we went through two thousand eighteen but despite all of these headlines around trade was when you actually look at the currency yes we see little bit of weakness but really its been you know more resilient maybe than one might have expected as we look through two thousand and nineteen Bryony seeing value in the currency or do you feel that this kind of further weakness to come here the R. and B. is  its in a bow moving currency a its a for all intensive purposes its a managed trade weighted currency and specially you can start to see how domestic monetary policy in China is playing a bigger role in the direction of the currency so you mentioned that it was we could during two thousand and eighteen which was the reverse of two thousand seventeen versus the US dollar because monetary policy gross trajectories are actually diverging so thats what currency should do in two thousand and eighteen the PBS see was easing monetary policy the U. S. fed was actually starting to hike grows trajectories between the two were actually starting to diverge the U. S. a stronger China was starting to moderate so you should see a currency behave that way like an actual stable thats what they do thats one of the great things about having a currency but I want to bring out this this this point on value I want to bring out a point on body I mean Linda when you look at the cars you see value so tough question is a as an as an insider in people always trying to do diversification because we see the crowd expansion speed right its so much faster than a nominal GDP gross thats why internal wise I think the most people always have a of a of a feeling of fear of the currency depreciate thats why the the willing to put the money into things like  you know  properties on or even how the cars you know but does not keep cash so , in the context of of your portfolio if you can you can be edging out currency is a U. hedging the currency the moment Im we have been hedging the currency for the past month or so Id say roughly two weeks before sort of the trade was not against came back to surface and the reason for that is we sort of thought that the currency hard gone a long way so far this year he was pricing in a lot of good news the hedging costs as a result had come down quite significant loss youre hedging costs were about three and a half to four percent almost the entire coupon youd be getting from bonds on the other hand sort of a month ago so they could go doubt two basis points from our end pricing very good use and hedging because very very low we thought that was a good opportunity to read you some of our remain the exposure yeah the interest rate differentials of completely convey between the arm be in the US  between China and the U. S. excuse me so those hitching Costa negligible now I wouldnt say this value in the currency only because theyre a downside risks there a psychological eat Barry is if you will typically for the domestic consumer in domestic confidence that seven is it is an issue but frankly it should be able to break through that if China needs to be able to adjust to a relatively high level of debt to GDP if it needs to use that as a tool within the trade will negotiations may be but currencies need to go up and down to be an actual stabilize and the problem is with the clothes capital account with a with a managed currency , its ability to do that has both very strong pros and cons just turning to the economy more brought ME one of the things international investors really struggle with Linda result you try to get a read on the Chinese economy I mean from inside the country whats your view on where we are are in the business cycle how do you get a read on the on the economy its also very easy even for the domestic  prison because the volatility in the GDP number its very very little and to some extent doesnt really reflect you know how the economy change is so we do have some a a better indicator is things like power generation things like our discussion  spending on some of the key items I think its more kind of close to the reality type of parameters and also I have for some its an old channels yeah , I base things on her eyes  I I took a taxi  suit is shed car on system twice a day  so I could take taxes twice today yeah okay , thats actually quite a good value for that because we still got a lot of internet dying subsidized phone that shed car on service so  I took the drivers to I said date the interesting thing is these taxi drivers theyre not full time taxi drivers  most of time they have another job and quite some time to actually as in the owners  you know so at their leisure time to can decide  some additional measure me small scale comes along smart guys my media and  enterprise they can give you the really fresh hand kind of information of whats open on the ground like for example one of the driver I may remember lost yeah he raced picks and then the , yes Sir so you know he told me its very tough laws to yeah you know in in its business and he was thinking that hed be may close down its business and then the you know switch to another one so thats typically the ethnic and signal of trials of the cycle of the of the pick my kids and how did you act on that I mean what you do on the back of that information usually that will give you some idea of you know when the kind of turning point in and also  it give you you know its just give you an idea so after that I need to prove that I talk to the  the really big skill pick raising companies to see if thats only in a closed city the down cycle all of the market I think that probably gives me some of the information earlier you know  quicker before I really picked up some news from from you know  the Bloomberg all you know from an SL side report its really kind first hand information you know one of the things that Im really interested in a moment is ready the role that kind of money tree policies playing and  I mean Brian I dont know how effective you think the Chinese authorities have been in terms of the use of of of monetary policy to manage the come to me should the the the folks at the sort of peoples bank of China should they be talking to sort of the pic FAMAS as well for what its worth Im certain they op because thats an important component of inflation its a food in particular is a big part of the a consumer price index and its just a big part of the disposable income and I think what weve noticed with the PPO see is that their monetary policy framework they formalized open market operations have really stepped up quite meaningful in the last couple of years from officially from a member of two thousand and fifteen so monetary policy is now becoming a much better tool and you can monitor that through again the formal open market operations you can look at it which shorthand funding costs so this is actually a much better indicator we would say of what the central bank is actually doing rather than just what they sang and so you can actually start to see over the last couple of years that tightening of monetary policy the easing of monetary policy I have a two thousand and seventeen and eighteen respectively were very clear to see and that helped us without positioning it helped us get conviction that helped us to add risk at the end of last year and the other thing that I think is very relevant to that its its all very into connected as you can imagine is oversee the currency and interest rate differentials we talked about that before but then its even just look at the credit impulse that that that credit grossed within the within the economy this is critical in assessing and evaluating the cycles in the mini cycles that we see within China or very related to each other because monetary policies not just credit grows we also need to add things like fiscal impulse or local government spending for example and it and if we sort of turned to sort of micro potential matches more broadly in George again you know to to live off the same question you not I look at it despite lots of different  economies and governments talking about micro provincial measures you could argue that she that Chinas been one the most effective at using macro prevention measures to control the come to me Im I am I right in thinking that well last year we have had the de leveraging come pain and or your dot has been working but at the same time he has also had some unintended consequences and actually the links very much to to what Sir Brian talked about you the credit cycle in the credit so the could impose what happened last year was that companies that needed liquidity that needed credit flow the most these as a private companies in a small and medium sized enterprises is these companies did not have oxes anymore to landing and as a result we started seeing an increase of the full total more more spread volatility in the own show born market and that seemed and because , small and medium size enterprises in China private companies in China they make up a big part off Chinas employment about seventy to eighty percent off urban employment and if we think of you know China and your the political spectrum in China they key the key sort of our objective here is I would say social stability how we can relate to that to the economy something more tangible that we can monitor  I would argue that that is employment entry not seeing unemployment rising if private companies are having issues and what issues because theyve been poorly managed but issues because theyre not finding access to liquidity then that is a bad thing because it can lead to rising unemployed mint now that was identified as an accountant unintended consequence by the market by the by the PBUC middle of last year they started stepping up on that front and as a result thats from my perspective that was a catalyst to start out in two risk especially in Chinese corporates yeah the macro prudential policy that weve also seen which I think is a little bit may expect I think youre right Paris its its been a pretty good example of of how it can work at Sydney its Kyle thats for sure clearly would say over many years quite extensive policy controls around the property market around lending standards thats actually created some distortions frankly its  a mixed result if you will the other macro potential policy its probably is torturing and stretching the term in the definition a little bit its just really being about the cost of funding so the overall cost of funding the allocation of capital within the economy has been very heavily skewed toward state owned enterprise and with good cause through decades of rapid development this is a necessary a very valid way to create capital to generate fixed asset investment infrastructure and everything that goes with it the problem however is over time if the cost of capital its not price correctly you then get a missed allocation of capital and one of the nice things that we see about the development of a domestic bond market is that it starts the process of pricing capital better and when you price capital better you a much higher chance of that capital being allocated more efficiently its not perfect it just means that good quality companies get rewarded with a lower cost of funding and vice versa its a work in progress the bond market helps you do that  but thats I would argue the number one financial market reform for China the efficient pricing and allocation of capital and the bond market helps with that but theres still a lot more to be done and and and not just the bond market  so the inclusion off China into the the Bach listen this is a tetra which will slowly find international institution investors Im coming to the market in again helping with pricing that risk more efficiently does all that down  miss allocation of capital point at this time over on the easing again a very different feeling because you know from the recent like the airport a PPO Simmons sleek commentary youre ready feel that they started to tighten a little bit off to you know the first court of rip big skill of easing so so this time around that damn metallic its very different in a they want to just want to control the liquidity enough to support economy and not collapse but they dont want to really palm the set that the system was abundant liquidity in and create a lot of oppose or you know into the in another word allocate capital in a very inefficient way so so I think its also kind of maternity an attitude change on towards the easing and and definitely that brings more credit financing to direct equity financing Obon financing Im Brian you mentioned property in traditionally properties were up to seventy percent of Chinese house so wealth is tied up and my colleague Richard occurs hit the streets in Shanghai to see whats happening in the property market and what that could actually mean for the broader economy Paris Im in downtown Shanghai the center of the Pudong business district effect just outside our offices you can probably wave and Id see you but I  going to ramble to see some rather different areas different neighborhoods at the story they tell about Chinas economy today my guide is Alex J. fidelitys real estates analyst here in China its Alex will continue but at this time thank you very much that what an exciting time to be covering real estate Im I know that its you think that Shanghai is a little bit like China in minutes yeah if you could call a city like this of twenty six million people in any way maybe but tell me about the development here in this business districts what what to be looking at right now sure we are now standing in the very center of flu jazzy financial town and theyre around fourty beauties in this area  and in those beauties we have over two hundred thousand people working for the financial industry thirty years ago what was here feels and some very  shabby  neighborhood and then when the Chinese government decided to develop  dome area as the starting point of opening up and  we start to see a lot of buildings some of them up what beauty in the nineteen nineties but also some of them out what beauty and  to suntan so this is possibly the the the scene this makes people thing called when they they miss Florida sent me think of with us and but its Im your going to take these are all the different place yes of course  for the residential community in this really doesnt have a   their two camps one is a routes of five to ten minutes walk from our office and the other is around twenty minutes walk from our office and  Im actually living in the the the the twenty minutes camp says that we got some exercise to it to get on with it what the elite on yeah right Alex Wilson  philosophers exercise with many be walking from the back of a seven or eight minutes and here we are in the area that you were telling me if I am much more residential is leafy regardless of trees down this  the streets very attractive and helpful in a very Sonny  day here in Shanghai tell me about that the shops that we can see around  as you can see the most popular , agents restaurants coffee bars juice bars and I think all of these represents the fast growing service industry try so definitely is a structure trend however we can also see all of these cannons the turnover rate is very high , yeah all the churn rate which means some a lot of people trying to open the only shops however some people succeed to to survive for some people just to have to close down  just off the maybe that the the the tenant lease period said that this is your neighborhood you will coming down the street every day how often do you see yourselves ,  I have to say very often actually in front of us the three shops I didnt , even found a home that during the last weekend , a brand new yeah how long how long do you think theyll let us ,  well it depends I see the pro the agents formerly Los choir up here its because  they are the  the expert about so the amount and this dumpling shops  I think they see mainly serve the mid to low and customers can actually also survived by the log long time but this one which is seven this dude me kind of shops hi miss cords  specific amount  so Im not quite sure how long they can supply so dumb things yes Steve meets maybe no yeah and how in  sin is prophecy as an investment to people here in Shanghai the property price went up about thirty percent in time fifteen in another city pertain to a sixteen but after the two years  skyrocketing this has come and came in with intervention to curb the party bubbles in late two thousand seventeen so we then see a fifteen percent drop from the peak and  which buttons fabric this year and she adds up four six percent increase over edging up six percent when a good edging up isnt it  has , government intervention and the slowing of the incredible  and racing away has changed the way that people think affects focusing , well I definitely the property has become less attractive as an investment , at the same time your house is well , yeah because I bought to my apartment saying this area  you already taught sixteen so I enjoy the rally into sixteen hi  I also experienced a job into seventeen eighteen but Sir seven may I dont view that as a from the mass angle why more treat as a living purpose  I seen the one the purpose will come to control the Prof the bubble , it also prevents the property to , routing out too much consumption , so I think there will definitely be  structural trends for the Chinese household to allocate the assets out of property and gradually into other type of assets like equities fixed income and other type of things and also on the other hand to you have more common disposable income be allocated to consumption so thats a definite pose good for capital markets and consumption for the next decade , sitting here in the leafy streets of  only central St thank you much , Linda I want to explore this point Alex raised on consumer trends a bit more just does what he said really chime with you  not look I think its quite common to thinking that way  but from my kind of experience I I I I actually do food opposite way I think that you know you have your property prices riding is actually create slowed wealthy fact and increase your first or increase your consumption power in second its also increase to expect shin for the future grows so I do think that well see FAQ takes a big part of from the public price  its you know probably quite good for the for the consumption and also you know I DO experienced a very big dropping home company prior a step back into nineteen ninety seven when the property price drop the seventy percent so thats definitely going to decrease the consumption the increase one of things I discovered sort of meeting Chinese companies over over the last year is that it seems as if local Brians starting to resonate with consumers arguably more than international brands  Witt with very used to this idea that , international brands like night have global residents but but what really surprised me is prominence and growth an appetite for local brands is this is this is she a real shift that listing yeah it is a very strong phenomenon emergen and and and in the past decades I think the two reasons behind that first one is you have to local brands is really have to quality improved in terms of value for money it can give you a better a utility so this fundamental reasons why you know the local brands and imagine and second also from the consumer perspective what we the young generation their conception Patton is rooted different from you know my generation  theyre very theyre very focus on on taylormades demand  and also very focused on experience and also the quite focus on a kind of interaction of back so that sometimes you know the local brands the really good ads you know the very Fosse and changing their motto set designs to better on tailoring the younger generation customers wares international brands for example its very typical example is like PNG when they want to launch a new product and trying to fit into the younger generation they needs turns off process approval from the US based on  are in the center by the local cosmetics  or  FMCG brands to change even really one of the emerging stories ready that was about increasing household leverage on the credit side Brian is is is increasing house so barring a concern for you the level of household debt is always something we need to be thinking about in any economy at the tiki around the rate of change someones property  properties plural as is often the case within China and the mortgage associated to that is is typically the largest part of that household debt that will affect and everything that was to the bat is overseen important part of that the good thing is generally speaking we dont see excessive levels of debt in the household sector other than the investors and even then its been difficult to have excessive amounts of debt within the house  sector but as we start to think about things like auto leasing for example if we start to think about the the use of consumer credit this is a much trickier part of the household that problem because usually its a higher cost of funding its usually brings forward concern shin and and of course its hard for that to sustain rapid growth and that actually is what brings about cyclic Kalecki within more developed economies like the U. S. for example which is very much domestic driven with a large amount of domestic reddit focus and household debt focus I mean the development of China credit scoring systems of social scoring systems is clearly a way to try and rein in and self regulate if you will but I guess Im not concerned about household leverage at this point of stage but my goodness its its increase quite significantly over the last few years so its definitely something we need to be watch ing and mindful of one more thing to look up to that is in a monitoring household leverage levels but simultaneously monitoring savings rates levels which historically and continues to be one of the highest globally if dot Stasi tearing at a time when house will leverage is moving upwards that would be more warring dynamic havent really seen that yet hopping any meaningful way agree with some Bryant it does rise very very quickly but my feeling is that is to pretty much links to the mortgage the mortgage downs is still so far the largest a pond all of the household on the average so again you know it links back to the question of party price my view is property price is going to be stable not collapsing and as long as is the case I dont think in in some mortgage type of  how to leverage is going to be a big problem what does a really helpful insight if I wanted to bring this all together I mean what weve really learned today is that the Chinese market the capital markets are you continuing the process of opening up a really be seen the pace really accelerate over over the last twelve months whos really interested to hear that you know all view on the management of the Emmys by the Chinese authorities we were getting all the credibility for both the FF a concealed monetary policy as well as the the the market potential matches and the while Swiss seeing a maturing real estate cycle and potentially a kind of a all mixed outlook for real estate that in fact the the consumption story continues apace and of course well be keeping a very close eye on picks that brings us to the end of our show today Id like to thank my guests Lindgren Alex in Shanghai and Brian and in Hong Kong the producers were Richard occur in Shanghai a new golf and said Moulton clocked in Hong Kong if you like what youve heard state to subscribe rate and review us on your part cost out until next time thanks for listening and goodbye this podcast is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by private investors this part cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the pass and all and he switches to censor must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may get back less than you invest the other important legal notices please see our website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
20,21,"this podcast is for investment professionals I nearly , hello and welcome back to rich pickings with entities axes allocation part because under today editor in chief and you join me on a very wet June day here in the city of London on sheltering answer rain what is what outside the views we have inside this put coast  anything box I replacement teams have made a significant shift away from risk we discuss why in this episode plus they have the US China trade war is weighing on their thinking  petitions leading us to economic only get in over markets take it all in their stride listen on to find out , with me in the studio to distill this months and on occasion our when when Lindros leads cross acid strategists synonyms head of asset management for Asia Pacific Im James Bateman a chief investment officer for multi asset welcome to you all hello well lets start with the usual leftfield question that reveals the real you you this month can you tell me the one thing that you prefer to do the old fashioned way Paris and stuff with you thank you Richard I suppose the one thing I prefer today to do the  fashion ways reading Ive never been able to get on board with the readers I also that you prefer a halt I books as well then given that I I travel a lot means that Im Im normally carrying as excess baggage excess baggage yes exactly excellent when when havent you Im going to talk about something a little bit heavy which is moral values  Im reading a book called the road to character by David Brock X. and its about some twentieth century figures  they embody characteristics that are really centered around civic values and improving society but without seeking celebrity so old fashioned civil values I am for you and James what Richard you cannot rely on me to take things from the deep and meaningful to the shallow and superficial so I would say make cocktails  because I couldnt resist the pound excellence okay well Im glad you said it so I didnt have to now lets get to the  asset allocation to her view as agreed across all of the asset classes at women take history there was some significant news this time yes  at our asset allocation meeting weve decided to go  decidedly more risk off and even though the underlying economic into it airs R. D. sense we are concerned about trade war impacts as well as valuations so specifically  inequities for the near term view weve gone from neutral to under weight  within government bonds weve gone from under way to overweight in the near term over the medium term view weve gone from under way to neutral and then within corporate credit weve gone from overweight to neutral both in the short term in the medium term so in sum this reflects are more at defensive posture given the risks that were facing sounds pretty risk off doesnt it Im a Paris gathering underweight equities  in the in the short term at least thats quite a significant move it is a not you know it from from my perspective it could be looked at in some ways as a position that reinforces the kind of risk off perspective but actually when you think about what is driven markets especially equity markets over the last few months its really been linked to that dovish position that the fed has has taken so even if for example you had a more constructive view on the macro economy which I which I personally do that if I look at what markets a comedy pricing in today which is actually for the recall station from the fed is not fails to come through then that in and of itself will be quite bearish for market so Im Im Im very supportive of the view from that perspective in the sense that you know not not just if if we we end up in a risk often violent but actually if we end up in a in a in a tightening environment we dont expect okay and James were talking about the house for you which is made up of views across the the teams across the asset classes as head of mills yes it does it reflect your views and I a broadly does yes Richard so I think you know that the timing the nuances site different with the multi asset so we to to continue my my flippant see we did sell in may Ralph in June that a lot of that was I guess random timing meetings but I think hes already on your way down to where you have to yes may not reflect similar arguments that you know on the one hand the market data looks okay and that she could be good but the reality was mark is a good head of themselves are we worried about valuations and were very worried that this sort of trigger if the fed was on you can ever be to the down not to the upside and Id like to pick up not view that James reflected on on valuations because to me that is one of the common denominators around all of these decisions that weve taken so you look at the the house view the kind of when when is laid out and you can say it it flexing totality of a risk off position but I should look at the underlying decisions and I think the one thing that supports the mold is the fact that we are seeing little value in many of the asset classes across the market so that so that but thats one way looking at the DC because one of the things that struck me is that I am the fly the fidelity leading indicator which comes from your team James thats looking remarkably positive now having beam in the doldrums for as long as I can remember  eight now hosting into positive social grace it is so what we sound that is you know one hand looks superficially very good Im on the other hand the pre two main cavea one is the mark created doesnt drive markets  this connection but it said he doesnt drive and maybe that might occur exploration is one into the pricing markets are ready on the second issue is almost by definition leading indicators are trying to predict the future and the reasons why you believe it the reasons why you might have some caution around and therefore would say that the extent of the positivity it showing moment is is probably higher than the reality and when when Im the discussions thats closest to it to this point and what was the main threads that you remember from that well were spending a lot of time analyzing the trade war and I would say that this is something that not necessarily captured and fly  in things can happen on such a short notice now with trump tweeting about the trade war an escalating the situation on may fifth so this is new information that wouldnt necessarily have been cat turn and fly but it has huge ramifications for what will happen for throughout throughout the rest of the year I think you know when when when we think about positioning we think about sort of exogenous risks like geo politics tried what set truck you have to kind of relate as back evaluation embarrasses point that the when valuations that reasonable that the downside risks to to some unexpected news for maybe trump increasing terrace rather some some escalation that its a war is not a major way on on risk assets the promise with valuations of the campus wretch on the downside risk is really quite high I think were in that position the reason were risk of partly is because there are clear Blaine re downside risks that could be quite beagle markets given valuations Im on one the most interesting things that came out in all discussion we west should have dissected the shape of markets over the last few months was really the the non  follow through in terms of flows so even though the market action has been very positive we havent seen the kind of flows towards risk assets but would give you that security that this is something that that didnt sort of feel fried Joss exactly is is James said whether its its trade will weather is something else that was just that feeling of fragility around the bull market a lack of substance  a to Z. as well and I space another thing thats  fascinating at the moment is a remarkable turnaround and signals from the US federal reserve which until recently was  implying that would be  hike on the horizon and now its indicating it be willing to cut interest rates to assess any damage from those trade wars and ignoring information that might be coming from the the trade was when when I mean that that thats a remarkable turnaround isnt it it S. at the end of twenty eighteen at the market was pricing and a few  hikes for twenty nineteen  and at this point were looking at  a total of eighty basis points of of cuts priced into the treasury markets so its been a very rapid turnaround and I would say that this is partly due to the very quick pets and policy that do come from the very top president trump so the signals around US inflation have been pretty mudah two year to date  and the fed is doing some work in terms of how they want to analyze is it going forward from a personal perspective I do think that inflation is set to rise because of the terrorists and because of the tight labor conditions but this is a question that is out there in the market that people are trying to answer if you surprise I suppose if inflation didnt rice because the prices have been passed on to American consumers lets have a moment to think about the impact of the trade was themselves on on economic grace only in respect to markets research analyst incense and he gave a relatively upbeat outlook on the impacts of the step medic to speech , welcome in I am I know that youve been looking into the impact of the the trade war whether it is a war yes or no between China and the United States and as long as the tax if this trade war remains confined to the US and China Im you think its going to be the killer blow to to the rest of the world why is that while looking at some of our estimates of the impacts of even the worst case scenario twenty five percent tariffs on all Chinese exports to the US and Chinese retaliation we think over the next two years that probably takes off not point two percent to not point three percent after US GDP growth and and clearly more in China props more like zero point five percent or even one percentage points next year and thats meaningful but its also small enough for manageable enough the other policies so not trade policy but fiscal policy and credit policy can offset it so if it does come to post photos  these effects that you said , how should people try and understand the impact that again to have lets say on on the US economy well one good way to think about this is that the US consumes about seven half billion barrels of oil every year thats roughly costs about four engine eighty billion dollars say ADD and what theyll prices  Im not forty billion dollars is very close to the total minds of imports that the US takes from China so if this is just to explain is buying as much oil as it does good to anything else from China so that that roughly equivalent in a sense yes so if you think about a twenty five percent shock to the old price not survive fifteen dollars higher and oil and the tariff is is basically a price shock so fifteen dollars higher well it does Hey its growth certainly is higher input costs but it doesnt believe people screaming and that were about to get a major recession and so for me thats thats the comparison by making my head so we were able to weather  the  the ups and downs of oil prices and what what kind of used to that we should maybe think about it Im terrace in the worst case even in the worst case as  being some a similar sort of experience son of Pervis analogy but its a good start great so less damaging to the what about aids data from China was at ten you about its ability to cope with the effects of a trade war so we have seen a we saw going into the start of this year a significant slowdown in Chinese days actually  since about February things have stabilized perhaps slightly improved and and most of that slowdown was I sure laces to fiscal and credit policy that starts its , in China domestically almost a year ago not if you think how much it slowed his results of that fiscal ins and credit policy battles gives you a sense of how much leeway they have to re stimulate the economy to help contracts some of the effects of the trade war do you think they will , I think were already seeing and significantly increased stiffness out of China in the first quarter of this year and , given that the increase tensions the the chance of that extending even further and his only recent , Sir Ian so sin and dumb idea he was saying that the impact of terrorists is roughly equivalent to oil I have to tell you that sitting here in the studio when when was shaking head somewhat you you dont agree wise wise that women well I am more pessimistic on  trade war impacts versus oil I think that when oil goes up you have beneficiaries like MP companies and oil producing countries there are periods of time like two thousand six or  way toward two thousand twelve through fourteen when oil prices went up and it did not can strangle growth on the other hand trade wars I think that most people would agree that the impacts are just broadly negative and there arent really any winners only losers you know coming out of the trade tensions to trump thinks hes winning hashtag winning there are little Colenso to be made you are absolutely right and does this is so important  to consider but in terms of economic impacts , A. tensions lead to tighter financial conditions number one lower business and consumer confidence number two so eventually there has to be a negative impacts scene in the real economy because of trade tensions , Im in had a fairly rosy view the results of his analysis Im a but what do you think of the it is risks to that , so I think the first risk if I if I pick up on the wall and so the point of optimism that when when made which is at the raw political winds to be had I actually think that may be the political winds to be had from movies like this are probably less than people think and certainly less and the president trump thinks and and the and the logic goes as follows is that you throw up in the air the terms of trade between two significant economic blocks and you think that they can be resolved in the kind of time frame that mirrors the time the time frame of the new operation or the or the kind of the launch of the of the issue and then what you what happens though is that when youre thinking about and its true as a as true breaks it as it is true all of the the China  U. S. try it will is that the devil is all in the detail Im not detail is painstaking detail it takes far longer to to sort of work out so so what might seem like a political win in the in the beginning my at G. C. political capital being warned that as you go through the process and you make the comparison with breaks in shortly if you wanted to see an example of where a thriving trade deals up in the air and then hoping youre going to be able to sort it out before the full time here in the U. K. we switch sign that that isnt as simple as as the I think exactly and you can also you can also count the political cost of that to to to the Tory leadership I think the other point I would make is that what to think that the the context the input surrounded them with with the  price  makes a lot of sense that is presuming that youre dealing with a relatively bounded problems so youve got that you got in all price you can see the impact on it the issue for markets with something like a trade war is it is very hard for us at this point to bound the problem you can even found making some assumptions about US versus China but at G. when you think about this as a as a sort of a trace trashy more broadly what about the impact to Mexico what about the impact on Europe thats the issue for markets as you compounded in the same way and how were you looking at how this might unfolds in terms of impact on corporate earnings I think there is quite a downside in and I just wanna pick up one thing on the on the  price which is of course you can presume  with the  price that the over the meantime is range bound and therefore even if its high one year it might be river next year the real risk is with with tariffs is you could have a situation where the the current level becomes the low not the high for the next five years  and that clearly is is economically very consequential but if as Paris says moves globally so so what we worry about we were about him gently risk assets as we talked about but we also worry about specific areas and sectors so what worries us all what could be impacted by surprise or maybe not surprise terrorists so we look maybe slightly cover in saying that weve been underway last time for some time  on the on the basis of most record like much markets under at that time within the on the basis of concerns about around the terrorists in the area were also very short  European autos Im not going to affect the same thesis that the there is a and there are other reasons to shop there is one and all of you but but from a terrorist but if its a very easy pain point in and what we see from trump his put tariffs on first negotiate later which is you know very much the opposite for traditional approach which is leave them as a latent threat some point on the line but dont dont suits you could see overnight terrace put in place and something that then brings Europe the negotiating table that we we were talking here about a terrace almost in isolation we weve touched on possible Im stimulus from that the fates Im in the markets pricing in  for cuts will sells Paris kids authorities  do Im in China for example how likely would they be to to step up their tents to to keep the Chinese economy taking eva if this really does begin to route to bite so some my view is that I see most domestic governments central banks continuing a statement stimulates ripoff full that domestic economies which is why Im more optimistic about the global macro economic pay sure  the many of my colleagues and I think that they do this in part because they understand the political and economic costs of pursuing a more nationalistic agenda so its almost the quid pro quo but I do see the weight of that stimulus as we look forward being much more on terms of the fiscal side than on the monetary side simply because it among the three policy I think is largely played out as a stimulus and has not Julie resulted all keep early in some of the imbalances that have led to the focus on the nationalistic political agenda how does that then play yards when you go its government sets  a pretty much indebted to her and the world at my theyre going to have to borrow more Im in order to to from the sort of fiscal stimulus Im about to worry isnt it when when yes I think that you know we feel that fiscal spending is going to increase from here basically to satisfy  populism which has emerged around the world thing and this is going to elevate tied to GDP ratios and and how does that set us up James them so you know Im Im less worried about the the most people I think the reality is that the response financial crisis was not that willful threw in the sense that it into the even bigger crisis didnt necessary worry about imbalances weve talked about and and I I know for you to to this in previous posts costs my biggest concern is social cohesion and and the gap between rich and poor and and that she really its the gap between the a quarter of the local Ptolemy is this is this just been this enormous  bifurcation of winners and losers driven pot by metropolis and other things and the the sort of greater than lost decade for individuals our little individuals in society needs to be addressed that has to be done through fiscal policies only to do it it seems very small price to pay to issue more debt to do that I actually think markets would be a competitive in positive on that move down prudently by the rights of the politicians past you agree I do I Im I think look that they were there a couple of points I would make one is that we we think about this  ratio the people quote which is debt to GDP that is a that has kind of limited explains the power because youre comparing a stock which is the the quantum of that with the flow which is which is G. D. P. AJ if you look at the the quantum of debt versus the cost of servicing the debt I. T. debt servicing costs are very low at the moment so the affordability all of all the larger of a long trip on the sheet that could change I mean were talking just not affect inflation rising as a result of ten yes that youre going to see a significant bump  soaks again my personal view on this is that because of the conditioning around inflation because of the conditioning  off of all bond markets the both bond markets and central banks will be very slow to to pick up on this and Im also have this view that it is harder and harder to measure the Molteni calling me and hands the views on inflation the published data on and may not give you the accurate picture on whats actually happening up prices on the line so Id like to draw an analogy to where we are today back to the US in the nineteen twenties thirties and forties the level of inequality in the US right now is it can see what we had in the nineteen twenties that was followed by the election of FDR to introduce the new deal to get people back to work  and so what were seeing in the from the progressive left in the U. S. today is the introduction of the green new deal and if they are like policies  but ultimately that isnt what solves the problem in the US of inequality and slow growth that such track it was World War two  so looking at it from sort of a broader perspective we may be adding for a larger type of reckoning  it is recognized that inequality is get solved orchard in a way by either war or dizzy is but on a more positive note we also think that a third industrial evolution could get us out of this right when I rather hope is that rather than the the apocalyptic  persons that so do I you are you referring to that James do you do you said this this concern you see but both you and parents seem to be significantly more optimistic in this  conversations hot known to me not to not to send more to see them when when so just to let you know the womans right I mean interesting of course is is the timing of sequence is different in the you know when after I was elected veces the Great Depression if we draw the power of our were in a different timing sequence theres no getting away from the large seismic events can unequivocally redress balances and in fact in a World War one had a similar impact in a lot of respects but there were two very simple twenty sentries on because well thats the case the right as he is there are lots of other ways to redress balances on I think either political will to do so and and and some actors it Katie actually favor that some dont but it is politically possible to deal with that and Paris alluded to its harder to measure economy as Israel it is a lot easier to measure and understand sentiment and whats making people unhappy whats creating unrest I think you know that in itself is probably something we would say differs from the past the , the rise of Twitter everyone having a voice is in in either in some respects terrifying others thats absolutely wonderful but you can really understand and measure what peoples binge but so what the concerns and its very clear what problems on now Im an inequality is very very solvable through through effective fiscal policy what is reducible through effective fiscal policy I think governments are waking up to the , on that listing source we move now or to , holiday game hot cakes and hot potatoes what we by like hot cakes and what would you dropped like a hot potato I am let me come to win win for us was your hot cakes so Im going to go long populism in short neo liberalism the trade through questions and even your estimate take you on things but he hit me with it so the two trade ideas  on the long ends I would go a long populism by going long volatility  so going long the FedEx index either three ETFs are options or simply by D. risking one support for their own decks yes how appropriate yeah exactly  and then the second is my expectation that inflation in the US is going to rise more than people expect on a combination of the terrorists and the quite tight labor market so  I would go along real duration in taps  as a play on inflation and then on the short ads I would  play populism in the U. S. by  going shorts or underweight healthcare stocks specifically image Karen pharma and then in the U. K. I would short a basket of U. K. utilities which are obviously a focus of the labor party here okay if they  if they come to power okay James how about you your hot cakes so so I think I I have a short to medium term ha ha okay can asylum to months the short to medium term is gold and I think that reflects the general sense risk aversion to markets  the gold Montel not doing much for some time I and the fact that the eighties by the store value in for investors may even in panic so  from that point of view I think I think gold the other side I do think we have to somebody come from the the reality the anything that is truly green treaty  environmental  is let you talk me into my performance and I and whether that hes going back to a level tentative wind and solar leasing out with something a bit more direct in the equity market those varies medium term I think are you always kind of a scribe the long term value because  the the world is clearly shifting in that direction so green hot cakes and you hope it takes as something might might become potato  not necessarily for environmental reasons that they you could you could bring bill the often is oil Im concerned about Im concerned because I think the the macro date trees is looking too good and the route this is gonna be less good and I think supply constraints that were that if we look through next year of from the listening and put the two together  and that feels like a downward trajectory for oil Paris when we come to you your hot cake so I go to a hot cakes   this this week exactly  most of them contrary in both of them in some ways a line to this view that we all going to move into a phase of of of fiscal spending and that the world in general is going to perform better macro economically than than consensus so  I think still thing is undivided I think is missing is structurally undivided versus on a trade weighted basis and certain kinds of Dolla and also in in terms of the U. S.  I think that theres been this long bifurcation between growth and value if we have   infrastructure spending  if we see more wage inflation domestically in the U. S. which will I think the two about a consumption picture in in the medical I mean I think I think the be a lot of names in U. S. body that was kinda dusting down and having a look at as a result I do hope to to  so Im Im sure that all the medium term I do think that the the kind of insurance needed to  support the infrastructure spending and and the fiscal spending will will put downward pressure on the dollar and then secondly kind of more topic  I do think that one of the things that were learning from from reading the newspaper is the risk all of a holding illiquid positions in in liquid that traded vehicles and I I think I did I frankly just in case people on to weigh in the U. K. were talking a lot about me away and  his funds with a Im in trouble remembering gated to redemptions and hes invested a loss in a liquid exactly and I think I think we what weve seen you know over the last few years is oversee the popularity of OB T. S. exchange traded funds  which also in an instant liquidity to to the hold is  but I do think that as you dig into some of those funds that have been launched there are some the hold actually relatively lower liquid a positions on and I I think that that is an area that I would I would be looking to get dont be trouble ahead okay well thank you very much to the Paris and I hope thats giving you listening and insights into the thinking behind this months asset allocation if you like more detail is published in full on our website and if youd like to discuss anything be covered just speak your fidelity contacts thanks very much these my guests when when James Paris and in the produce it was said most and Clark thanks for listening goodbye , hes put cost is for investment professionals I only and should not be relied on by per invest as this part cost is provided for informational purposes only and is intended only for the person or entity switches to sense it must not be reproduced or speculated to any other party without prior permission of fidelity the value of investments can go down as well as up so you may back less than you invest the other important legal notices please see our website professionals dot fidelity dot co dot UK forward slash about hyphen fidelity "
